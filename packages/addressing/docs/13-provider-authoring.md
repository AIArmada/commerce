# Provider Authoring

This guide covers adding a new country geography provider to `aiarmada/addressing`. Follow it top to bottom; you should not need to read provider source for conventions. Copy `BrazilGeographyProvider` for a state-only country or `IndonesiaGeographyProvider` for a deep tree, then adapt. Copy `LaosAddressFormatter` for the UPU formatter.

The full pipeline is: **CSV → provider class → consumer registration → docs**. Each stage is required: data without a provider never seeds, a provider without registration is invisible (see [Provider registration](03-configuration.md)), and a provider without docs is a silent gap — see [05-country-data](05-country-data.md) and `resources/geography/README.md`.

## Contracts

A state-only provider implements three contracts; deep providers use the same three with more data. Formatters are separate.

```php
use AIArmada\Addressing\Contracts\CountryAddressAreaMetadataProvider;
use AIArmada\Addressing\Contracts\CountryGeographyProvider;
use AIArmada\Addressing\Contracts\CountryHierarchyProvider;

class BrazilGeographyProvider implements CountryAddressAreaMetadataProvider, CountryGeographyProvider, CountryHierarchyProvider
{
    public const string AREA_SOURCE = 'aiarmada_addressing_brazil_v1';

    private const string PROVIDER_KEY = 'aiarmada.addressing.brazil';

    public function providerKey(): string
    {
        return self::PROVIDER_KEY;
    }

    public function countryCode(): string
    {
        return 'BR';
    }
}
```

- `CountryGeographyProvider` (extends `CountryAddressProfile`) is the only required contract. It contributes `countryCode()`, the stable `providerKey()`, `seed()` for `State` rows, and `addressHierarchies()`.
- `CountryHierarchyProvider` is optional and contributes `addressAreaSource()` plus `stateAreaMappings()`. Every bundled provider implements it; without it the country has states but no area tree and no state↔area links.
- `CountryAddressAreaMetadataProvider` is optional and contributes `areaRoles()`, `areaNames()`, and `areaRelationships()`, all keyed by CSV `source_id`. Empty arrays are a normal pattern, not a gap.
- `CountryAddressFormatter` (extends `AddressFormatter`) lives in a separate class per country and is registered under the separate `addressing.formatters` key, not `addressing.geography.providers`. It contributes `countryCode()` plus `format(AddressData $address): string`.

## Designing addressHierarchies()

Return one `AddressHierarchyDefinition` per address structure the country needs. Every bundled provider uses the `administrative` hierarchy key with label `Administrative / Territorial Geography`; only Malaysia and Singapore add a second `postal` hierarchy, so a new provider should start with `administrative` alone.

List the primary hierarchy first: hierarchy order is the canonical cascade order (`CountryAddressProfileResolver::assignmentRoles()`), and first-wins lookups such as `stateLevel()` resolve ties by it. Malaysia lists `administrative` before `postal` because the land cascade (state → district → mukim) is primary and postal localities are the secondary delivery overlay.

When a state's proper term for an area type differs from the headline rendering, implement `CountryAreaTypeLabelProvider`: `areaTypeLabels()` for country-wide terms, `stateAreaTypeLabels()` for per-state overrides keyed by state code (Malaysia maps Kelantan `district` to `Jajahan`). `levelLabel()` resolves state override, then country base, then headline, so only genuine proper-term differences need declaring.

```php
use AIArmada\Addressing\Data\AddressHierarchyDefinition;
use AIArmada\Addressing\Data\AddressLevelDefinition;

public function addressHierarchies(): array
{
    return [
        new AddressHierarchyDefinition(
            key: 'administrative',
            label: 'Administrative / Territorial Geography',
            levels: [
                new AddressLevelDefinition(
                    key: 'state',
                    label: 'State / Federal District',
                    kind: 'state',
                    hierarchyType: 'administrative',
                    areaTypes: ['state', 'federal_district'],
                    areaLevel: 1,
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ];
}
```

- `kind` is `state` for the top level that mirrors `State` rows, `area` for everything below it. State-kind levels carry no `assignmentRole`: a `State` is selected through `state_id`, never as an area assignment. (Singapore is the exception that proves the rule: it has no states, so all its levels are `kind: 'area'`.)
- `areaTypes` / `areaType` constrain which CSV area `type` values may fill the level. Use the plural spelling; the singular exists only as a fallback and no bundled provider uses it. State-kind levels use `areaLevel: 1` (singular is the template norm here); area sub-levels use plural `areaLevels`.
- `parentKey` names the parent level `key` within the same hierarchy. It is required on every `area` level so hierarchy validation can walk upward.
- `assignmentRole` is effectively required on every `area` level: without it the role falls back to `{hierarchy}_{level}` (e.g. `administrative_district`), but every bundled area level sets an explicit role. Use the level key as the role (`mukim`, `regency`, `district`, `province`); only prefix with the hierarchy key when one country needs distinct roles per hierarchy (`postal_locality` vs `administrative_district` in Malaysia).

A deep level follows the same shape with `kind: 'area'`, for example Indonesia's regency level: `areaTypes: ['regency', 'city']`, `areaLevels: [2]`, `parentKey: 'province'`, `assignmentRole: 'regency'`. Related types may share one level and role when the addressing semantics are identical.

## The two-hierarchy rule

When a country exposes both an `administrative` and a `postal` hierarchy, every area row must pass the evidence bar of the hierarchy it sits in — and a row that fails one bar must be relocated, never silently discarded:

- **Administrative rows require legal backing**: a gazette, an official boundary book, census admin geography, or an equivalent legal inventory. A real place with no legal standing as an admin unit must not sit in the administrative hierarchy.
- **Postal-locality rows require delivery backing**: a postcode assignment from the national postal operator **plus** recognition as a distinct place by at least one official source (census locality list, electoral geography, local government). No postcode, no locality.
- **Relocate, don't delete.** A row that fails its hierarchy's test moves to the other hierarchy when it passes that bar (a non-gazetted town becomes a postal `locality`, keeping its postcodes). Delete only rows that pass neither bar: non-places, duplicates, errors. Move rows that are merely misfiled.
- **No cross-hierarchy dedup.** The same place may exist in both hierarchies under different types (a gazetted bandar and its postal town are different truths, not duplicates).
- **Postal areas need state-ancestor links.** Any postal row parented below the state must carry a shortcut relationship to its state ancestor in the `postal` hierarchy type, or region-scoped selectors cannot resolve it.

## stateDefinitions and seed()

`seed()` populates `State` rows from a private `stateDefinitions()` list of `['name', 'code']` pairs, keyed by `[country_id, code]`:

```php
private function stateDefinitions(): array
{
    return [
        ['name' => 'Acre', 'code' => 'AC'],
        // ...
    ];
}
```

Use the country's own subdivision codes: ISO 3166-2 second parts (`AC`, `JK`), alpha codes (`BB`…`TH` for Germany), ISTAT numbers (`21`…`88` for Italy), or official numeric strings (`13`, `14` for Bahrain). State names use official endonyms with diacritics (`São Paulo`, `Bayern`, `Piemonte`). Mirror `resources/data/states.json` for names, codes, and ordering so the provider and the bundled data never drift. If a definition changes (a renamed or merged subdivision), delete the stale rows in `seed()` so reseeds converge; Indonesia and South Korea both carry such cleanup.

## areaNames, areaRoles, areaRelationships

All three are keyed by CSV `source_id` and synced with `source = providerKey` on every geography reseed, which is why provider-managed names can be deleted and recreated freely while `manual` aliases survive.

```php
/** @return array<string, list<array{name: string, name_type?: string, is_preferred?: bool}>> */
public function areaNames(AddressCountry $country): array
{
    return [
        'id:province:31' => [
            ['name' => 'Jakarta', 'name_type' => 'common', 'is_preferred' => true],
            ['name' => 'Daerah Khusus Jakarta', 'name_type' => 'official'],
            ['name' => 'DKJ', 'name_type' => 'abbreviation'],
        ],
    ];
}
```

- `areaNames()` holds variants of the canonical CSV name: `historic` (Nanggroe Aceh, Irian Jaya), `official` (full ceremonial forms), `common`, `abbreviation`. English exonyms go here as `alternative` (Germany and Italy carry them); they never replace the canonical name. Return `[]` when the country needs no variants.
- `areaRoles()` maps each shipped `source_id` to its roles (`role`, `country_code`, `is_primary`). Derive it by iterating `addressAreaSource()->areas()` with a `match` on `$area->type`; role names are 1:1 with types and `is_primary` is `true`. Folding a minority type into the majority role (Laos maps `prefecture` areas to the `province` role) is allowed when the distinction carries no addressing meaning, but 1:1 is the norm.
- `areaRelationships()` derives parent links from each area's `parentSourceId` with `relationship_type: 'contains'` and the hierarchy type. Single-level countries keep the boilerplate loop; it is a no-op by design because top-level rows have no parent.

## stateAreaMappings and key stability

`stateAreaMappings()` links each `State` (keyed by its `stateDefinitions` code) to its level-1 area:

```php
/** @return array<string, array{area_code: string, source: string, area_level: int, hierarchy_types?: list<string>}> */
public function stateAreaMappings(): array
{
    return [
        'AC' => [
            'area_code' => 'AC',
            'source' => self::AREA_SOURCE,
            'area_level' => 1,
            'hierarchy_types' => ['administrative'],
        ],
        // ...
    ];
}
```

`area_code` is the CSV `code` column, not the `source_id`. When state codes and area codes differ (Indonesia maps ISO `AC` to Kemendagri `11`), the mapping is where the translation lives; most countries use an identity map. `area_level` is always `1`. `hierarchy_types` may be omitted unless one state must resolve different roots per hierarchy (Malaysia declares both).

Two keys with different stability rules:

- `AREA_SOURCE` (public const, `aiarmada_addressing_<country>_v1`) identifies one feed import. It is versioned: bump it when the source data changes incompatibly.
- `providerKey()` (private const, `aiarmada.addressing.<country>`) identifies the long-lived owner of everything the provider seeds. **Never change it**: reseeds deactivate, delete, and recreate areas, aliases, roles, relationships, and state links scoped to this key. Changing it orphans the old rows instead of refreshing them.

## CSV format and source_id conventions

One file per country at `resources/geography/<slug>-address-areas.csv`, loaded through `CsvAddressAreaSource($path, self::AREA_SOURCE)`:

```csv
source_id,country_code,type,name,native_name,code,parent_source_id,level,latitude,longitude
br:state:acre,BR,state,Acre,,AC,,1,,
br:state:alagoas,BR,state,Alagoas,,AL,,1,,
```

- `source_id` is `<lower-iso2>:<type>:<slug-or-official-code>`: slugs for most countries (`br:state:acre`, `bh:governorate:capital`), official statistical codes where they exist (`id:province:11`, `id:regency:1101`, `id:district:110101`, `jp:municipality:01100`). It must be stable across reseeds and unique per feed.
- `level` is 1-based; level-1 rows leave `parent_source_id` empty. Deeper rows point at their parent's `source_id`.
- `code` carries the official subdivision code and is what `stateAreaMappings()` joins on at level 1.
- `native_name`, `latitude`, and `longitude` are usually empty; fill them only with trusted data.
- Canonical `name` values use official endonyms. English exonyms, historic names, and abbreviations belong in `areaNames()`, never in the CSV — except countries whose official administrative language is English, which use English canonically with no aliases.
- Names containing commas are quoted per RFC 4180 (`"Larut, Matang dan Selama"`, `"Praha, Hlavní město"`); the loader parses them with `fgetcsv`. Slugs strip diacritics and punctuation (`liquica`, `sao-paulo`, `sanaa`).

:::warning
`source_id` prefixes do not always equal the row type: Indonesian city rows use the `id:regency:` prefix and only the `type` column distinguishes them. Always match on the `type` column, never by parsing `source_id`.
:::

## Name twins and slug stability

Duplicate names are normal and must never be "fixed" by renaming: Bangladesh ships 8 division/district twins, Laos ships two Vientianes (`VI` province, `VT` prefecture), and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, and Latvia all carry city/region or municipality twins. Filter by `type` (or `code`), never by name alone, and call the twins out in the country's [05-country-data](05-country-data.md) section and `resources/geography/README.md` line.

When two rows share both name *and* type, the slug alone cannot disambiguate them. Resolve the collision properly first: Lithuania's city/district twins now differ by real type (`city_municipality` vs `district_municipality`) and name (`Vilniaus miestas` vs `Vilnius`), leaving the district slugs (`vilnius-58`) suffixed only as stability ballast. Only suffix both slugs with the lowercased code when the collision is genuine and unresolvable, and document the suffix in the same two places. Never invent a distinguishing type to dodge the collision.

## Level keys for mixed flat tiers

A single-level tier may legitimately carry two administrative tiers flat (Sri Lanka's provinces + districts, Burkina Faso's regions + provinces, Lithuania's counties + municipalities). Name the level `key` after the top tier (`province`, `region`, `county`), list every carried type in `areaTypes` top-tier-first, and join the labels with ` / `. Record the country as a depth-2 candidate in the [provider coverage registry](14-provider-coverage.md) so a future split has a starting point.

## State-only versus deep trees

Ship state-only (one `state` level, one CSV level, identity mappings) unless consumer addressing genuinely needs sub-state granularity. Most bundled providers are state-only. Deep trees exist where addressing or hierarchy selection requires them: dual-hierarchy Malaysia and Singapore, depth-3 Indonesia, and depth-2 Algeria, Bangladesh, Brunei, India, Japan, Jordan, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain, Türkiye, and Uzbekistan. When in doubt, start state-only — depth can be added later without breaking the state level, while shipping wrong depth forces consumers to carry it.

## The numeric-key gotcha

PHP casts numeric-string array keys to `int`, so `stateAreaMappings()` returns int keys for countries with numeric codes (see [Numeric state codes](05-country-data.md)). The contract documents `array<int|string, ...>` and the seeder stringifies keys before querying, so this is handled — but your mappings must still declare the codes as quoted strings (`'13' => ...`), and any consumer-side code touching mapping keys must stringify before comparing.

## Formatter layouts

Every provider ships a `CountryAddressFormatter` whose layout must be researched from the UPU addressing sheet for the country (`upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/<cc>En.pdf`), cross-checked against the national post or the UPU POST*CODE database. Training-data knowledge of postcode formats is not sufficient: Djibouti and Burkina Faso both have live 5-digit systems that secondary sources miss, and several UPU sheets contradict Wikipedia. No-postcode claims need two sources.

Pick the closest layout pattern and note the UPU source in a one-line comment:

- **Left** (`{postcode} {locality}`): Laos, Kyrgyzstan, most of Europe. Country prefixes (`HR-`, `LT-`, `AX-`) and spacing (`NNN NN`) pass through exactly as supplied.
- **Right** (`{locality} {postcode}`): Cambodia (province-anchored), Bhutan, Lebanon, Lesotho, Zambia. Latvia adds a comma (`RIGA, LV-1050`).
- **Comma-left** (`{postcode}, {locality}`): Kazakhstan, Belarus, Moldova.
- **Own line below**: Iran, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Malta, Ireland (Eircode), the UK-system Crown dependencies.
- **Own line above**: Albania, the only bundled country whose postcode sits above the locality.
- **None**: Hong Kong, North Korea, most of Africa. Print any supplied code on its own line; never drop user data.

Pass-through rules: formatters print postcodes exactly as supplied — they never add, strip, or validate prefixes and spacing. City/state twins that compare equal print once (`sameText` guard). The country line uses the short display name from `resources/data/countries.json` (`Iran`, not `IRAN (ISLAMIC REP.)`), except where the database spelling is unusable on mail (Isle of Man prints `Isle of Man`, not `Man (Isle of)`). When the model cannot represent part of the UPU line (Serbia's street-level PAK, Gabon's trailing office code), document the gap in the formatter comment and the country's [05-country-data](05-country-data.md) section instead of fabricating it.

## Testing a provider

Add `tests/src/Addressing/Geography/<Country>GeographyProviderTest.php` following the Brazil pattern, and run it per package:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --parallel tests/src/Addressing/Geography/BrazilGeographyProviderTest.php
```

Assert at minimum:

1. `seed()` creates every `State` (count plus one renamed-value check proving `updateOrCreate` overwrites stale names).
2. `stateAreaMappings()` covers every state code, with keys in a fixed order.
3. `addressHierarchies()` has the expected keys, kinds, and assignment roles.
4. `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('<ISO2>')` imports the tree: active-area counts per type, one `AddressAreaStateLink` per mapping, and any declared aliases present.

Then exercise the consumer path once: seed the country, create an address with the role assignments from the new hierarchy, and run `SyncAddressAreaAssignmentsAction` — unknown roles and wrong-level areas must be rejected, correct assignments must persist.

Add two formatter cases to `tests/src/Addressing/Geography/CountryAddressFormattersTest.php`: the main UPU layout with a real example from the research, plus one variant (missing postcode, twin dedup, or a documented edge such as a pass-through prefix). Use the country's real division names so the tests double as usage examples.

## Registering the provider

Registration is what makes a shipped provider visible: bundled providers go in the package's own `config/addressing.php` (`addressing.geography.providers` plus `addressing.formatters`), in alphabetical `use` order with entries appended per batch. Consuming apps enable countries through their published copy instead. See [Provider registration](03-configuration.md) for what registration gates and what happens without it. Finish by documenting the country in [05-country-data](05-country-data.md) (one section following the file's template), adding its line to `resources/geography/README.md`, and adding its row to the [provider coverage registry](14-provider-coverage.md).

## Role and area-type vocabulary

Every assignment role and area type in use across the bundled providers, extracted from `addressHierarchies()`. State-kind levels carry no assignment role; a `State` is always selected through `state_id`.

### Assignment roles

| Role | Countries | Area types | Levels |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `administrative_district` | MY | district, minor_district | 2–3 |
| `administrative_division` | MY | division | 2 |
| `administrative_subdivision` | MY | city, municipality, mukim, subdistrict | 2–4 |
| `daira` | DZ | daira | 2 |
| `district` | BD, ID, IN, PK, TR | district | BD 2, ID 3, IN 2, PK 2, TR 2 |
| `lga` | NG | lga, area_council | 2 |
| `liwa` | JO | liwa | 2 |
| `mukim` | BN | mukim | 2 |
| `municipality` | JP | municipality | 2 |
| `planning_area` | SG | planning_area | 2 |
| `postal_district` | SG | postal_district | 1 |
| `postal_locality` | MY | locality, precinct | 2 |
| `postal_sector` | SG | postal_sector | 2 |
| `province` | ES, MA | ES province; MA province, prefecture | 2 |
| `regency` | ID | regency, city | 2 |
| `region` | SG | region | 1 |
| `tuman` | UZ | tuman, city | 2 |
| `wilayat` | OM | wilayat | 2 |
| `zone` | QA | zone | 2 |

### Area types by level

Level 1 is always state-kind (one level per country, `areaLevel: 1`), except Singapore, which has no states: its level-1 `postal_district` and `region` are `kind: 'area'`.

State-level (kind `state`, level 1): administrative_region, arctic_region, area, atoll, autonomous_city, autonomous_community, autonomous_district, autonomous_oblast, autonomous_region, autonomous_republic, autonomous_sector, autonomous_territorial_unit, canton, capital_city, capital_district, capital_territory, city, city_municipality, city_with_county_rights, commune, county, department, dependency, district, district_municipality, districts_under_republic_administration, division, economic_prefecture, emirate, entity, federal_city, federal_district, geographical_region, governorate, island, krai, local_council, metropolitan_administration, metropolitan_city, municipality, nation, oblast, okrug, parish, popularate, prefecture, province, quarter, region, regional_unit, republic, rural_municipality, sheadings, special_administrative_region, special_city, special_municipality, special_self_governing_city, special_self_governing_province, state, state_city, territorial_unit, territory, town, union_territory, urban_community, urban_municipality, voivodeship, wilaya, wilayah_persekutuan.

Sub-state (kind `area`, level 2+, plus SG level 1): area_council, city, daira, district, division, lga, liwa, locality, minor_district, mukim, municipality, planning_area, postal_district, postal_sector, precinct, prefecture, province, regency, region, subdistrict, tuman, wilayat, zone.

### Naming new roles and types

- Use the country's own administrative term, lowercased with underscores: `mukim`, `wilaya`, `oblast`, `voivodeship`, `barangay`-style local terms over English approximations.
- Prefer reusing a generic role when the semantics match an existing one (`district`, `province`) over coining a near-synonym.
- Set the role to the level key. Prefix with the hierarchy key (`postal_`, `administrative_`) only when one country ships several hierarchies whose roles would otherwise collide.
- Keep one role per level; group related types under it (Indonesia's `regency` covers `regency` and `city`) instead of splitting roles per type.
