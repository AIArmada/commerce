# Country Data

For per-provider depth and dataset status at a glance, see the
[Provider Coverage Registry](./14-provider-coverage.md).

## Bundled Dataset

The package always bundles ISO 3166-1 country/territory data.

File location: `resources/data/countries.json`

The bundled `MalaysiaGeographyProvider` supplies Malaysia's State/Federal Territory catalog, two explicit address hierarchies, the AddressArea hierarchy, and State↔AddressArea mappings. The primary administrative/land hierarchy is `region → district / division / jajahan → mukim / subdistrict / bandar / pekan`; the secondary postal/address hierarchy is `region → locality / precinct / kampung`. It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MY')` after countries are seeded.

The dataset contains **250 records** — these are ISO 3166-1 address entities, not 250 sovereign countries. Records include:

- ISO2, ISO3, numeric codes
- Names (common, native)
- Phone codes
- Capital
- Country centroid coordinates
- Region and subregion
- Currency code
- Timezones
- Top-level domain
- Translated country names

Currency, language, and timezone reference data is owned and seeded by `commerce-support`:

- `currencies` from the shared currency catalogue
- `languages` from the shared ISO 639-1 catalogue
- `timezones` from the shared IANA timezone catalogue

Countries are linked to shared currencies and timezones through UUID pivot tables. The country table does not store currency or timezone JSON/scalar columns. Country-language relationships are intentionally not modelled until a trusted mapping dataset is available.

## What is NOT Bundled by Default

Without selecting a country provider, the following must be supplied by users through `State`/`City` models, `AddressAreaSource`, array imports, or CSV imports:

- States, federal territories, provinces, prefectures, emirates
- Districts, cities, towns, villages, mukim, neighbourhoods
- Postcodes and worldwide area hierarchies

## Bundled States and Cities

`states.json` and `cities.json` are bundled from the same nnjeim/world source. Seed the global files first; country providers then complement those rows using stable country-scoped identities. The Malaysia provider updates matching states in place and adds Malaysia-specific rows not present in the global file, such as Putrajaya. It does not seed shared commerce-support reference data. The bundled area source contains no canonical city mapping data.

## Malaysia area roles

Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan do not receive duplicate postal-town
records. Their Federal Territory is the administrative area, while localities,
precincts and settlements are address subdivisions.

- postal_locality: Kuala Lumpur localities, Labuan settlements and Putrajaya precincts
- administrative_district: districts
- administrative_subdivision: mukim and subdistricts
- region: states and Federal Territories

## Malaysia cross-boundary mukims

Several mukim names appear on both sides of a district or state boundary.
Every case was verified against gazettes, the JUPEM UPI boundary book, and
titled-land evidence (Sept 2026). The verdict in all four cases: distinct
same-named mukims, each with exactly one parent — never one mukim spanning
two parents. DOSM's "Sebahagian Mukim X (Peralihan ...)" phrasing describes
the 1974 Gombak-formation transfers, not current dual parentage.

| Mukim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Setapak | Two mukims: Gombak-side (Selangor gazette) and KL-side (Federal Gazette 2024, UPI 140007). A 1974-split remnant, administered separately ever since. |
| Ampang | Two mukims: Hulu Langat-side (MPAJ: "smallest county in the district of Hulu Langat") and KL-side (UPI 140001). The straddling *town*/MPAJ area is not a third mukim. |
| Batu | Two mukims: Gombak-side ("Mukim Batu bagi Daerah Gombak") and KL-side ("MUKIM BATU, DAERAH KUALA LUMPUR", UPI 140002). A third Mukim Batu sits in Kuala Langat. |
| Cheras | Two mukims: Hulu Langat-side and KL-side ("Mukim Cheras, Daerah Kuala Lumpur", UPI 140003). KL's P123 Cheras parliamentary constituency is a separate concept. |

## Kuala Lumpur mukims

WPKL has exactly seven gazetted mukims and no district (`TIADA DAERAH`), so
each hangs directly under the Federal Territory at level 2. Mukim rows use a
`mukim-` source-id prefix because the parliamentary localities already occupy
the bare names.

| Mukim | UPI / PLANMalaysia | DOSM census |
|---|---|---|
| Ampang | 140001 | 140101 |
| Batu | 140002 | 140102 |
| Cheras | 140003 | 140103 |
| Hulu Klang | 140004 | 140104 |
| Kuala Lumpur | 140005 | 140105 |
| Petaling | 140006 | 140106 |
| Setapak | 140007 | 140107 |

Notes:

- Bandar Kuala Lumpur is a gazetted bandar (UPI 140044), not a mukim, so it
  has no mukim row despite "Mukim Bandar Kuala Lumpur" title phrasing.
- The rows use the gazette/KWP "Hulu Klang" spelling; the JUPEM UPI
  "Hulu Kelang" form is stored as an alternative name.
- The duplicate Gombak "Ulu Kelang" mukim row was removed: Gombak has one
  Hulu Klang mukim, and "Ulu Kelang" is a gazetted town name there.

Evidence: JUPEM/MyGDI UPI book for WPKL (2nd ed. 2023), PLANMalaysia mukim
code list (state 14), DOSM census geography, Selangor State Gazette notices,
Federal Gazette P.U.(B) notices, ST licensee lists, and Bursa land
disclosures.

## Selangor mukim audit

Every Selangor subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Selangor (Sept 2026). All gazetted Selangor mukims were already bundled;
the fixes below correct mistyped towns, wrong districts, renames, and
non-gazetted rows. Bandar and pekan are distinct row types sharing the
`administrative_subdivision` role; renamed rows keep their common names as
alternative or preferred names so searches keep resolving.

Retyped to bandar (gazetted): Banting, Bandar Baru Bangi, Kuang, Kundang,
Selayang, Petaling Jaya, Saujana, Subang Jaya, Cyberjaya, Shah Alam, Kuala
Kubu Bharu. Retyped to pekan (gazetted): Meru, Sekinchan, Sungai Besar,
Puchong, Sungai Pelek.

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Port Klang | Renamed Port Swettenham, bandar | UPI Bandar Port Swettenham 01/41; "Port Klang" kept as preferred common name |
| Gombak | Renamed Gombak Setia, bandar | UPI Bandar Gombak Setia 09/43; bare "Gombak" not gazetted |
| Salak Tinggi | Renamed Baru Salak Tinggi, bandar | UPI Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi 10/42; bare name not gazetted |
| Tanjung Sepat | Renamed Tanjong Sepat, bandar | UPI Bandar Tanjong Sepat 02/43 |
| Jenjarum (Klang) | Moved to Kuala Langat as Jenjarom, bandar | UPI Bandar Jenjarom 02/41; town is in Kuala Langat |
| Batu Arang (Sepang) | Moved to Gombak, bandar | UPI Bandar Batu Arang 09/40; town is in Gombak |
| Bukit Rotan (Hulu Selangor) | Moved to Kuala Selangor, pekan | UPI Pekan Bukit Rotan 04/72; town is in Kuala Selangor |
| Jenjarum Barat / Utama | Removed | No such place or entity in UPI, gazettes, or SPR records |
| Johan Setia, Paya Jaras | Removed | Kampung/locality inside a mukim, not a UPI entity |
| Setia Alam, Denai Alam, USJ / UEP Subang Jaya, Taman Melawati | Removed | Developer townships inside a mukim, not UPI entities |
| Batu Caves | Removed | Town inside Mukim Batu, not gazetted at any level |
| Sabak Bernam, Hulu Selangor | Removed | District-name rows; the districts and their mukims already exist |
| Teluk Panglima Garang (Klang) | Removed | Wrong-district duplicate of Kuala Langat's Mukim Telok Panglima Garang |

Spelling follows the gazetted UPI form for renamed rows (Jenjarom, Tanjong,
Swettenham); rows that keep common spellings (Hulu Langat, Telok Panglima
Garang, Kuala Kubu Bharu) carry the UPI variant as an alternative name.
Postal links were repointed to the surviving rows; no postcode lost its
primary link.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 3 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Batu Caves, Teluk Panglima Garang (corrected to Kuala Langat, town
distinct from Mukim Telok Panglima Garang), and Sabak Bernam (town distinct
from Mukim Sabak; 45100 Sungai Ayer Tawar stays district-linked). Stay
deleted: the Denai Alam, USJ, Setia Alam, and Taman Melawati townships (all
share Shah Alam, Subang Jaya, or Kuala Lumpur codes) and the Johan Setia and
Paya Jaras kampungs (no own postcode).

## Genting Highlands

Genting Highlands is not a mukim of Bentong. Bentong has exactly three
mukims (Bentong, Sabai, Pelangai); the gazetted Genting unit is Bandar
Genting under Daerah Kecil Genting, excised from Mukim Bentong in November
2019 (Pahang Gazette Notifications 2497/2501, UPI 06/12/40). The dataset
models the minor district and the bandar; "Genting Highlands" is stored as
the preferred common name. Karak in the same pass was corrected from mukim
to bandar (UPI Bandar Karak).

The resort genuinely spans the Pahang–Selangor border: the Selangor
footprint (Highlands/RW Hotel, Skyway assets, Gohtong Jaya) sits in Hulu
Selangor district, Mukim Batang Kali, under MPHS planning authority — while
mailing with the Pahang postcode 69000. There is no gazetted Selangor-side
Genting entity, so no second row exists; never key state off the postcode.

Evidence: JUPEM UPI book for Pahang, Pahang Gazette 2019 declarations,
Genting Berhad annual-report land schedules (Selangor vs Bentong), the
Genting Highlands–Hulu Selangor RKK plan, and titled-land records on both
sides.

## Pahang mukim audit

Every Pahang subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Pahang (Sept 2026). Pahang has 11 districts plus 4 minor districts
(Genting, Gebeng, Jelai, Muadzam Shah — the last three created 2019–2021).
Retyped to bandar: Jerantut, Kuantan, Temerloh, Maran, Raub. Retyped to
pekan: Brinchang, Lanchang, Bukit Fraser, Kuala Rompin (UPI-listed, still
ungazetted).

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Gebeng (Kuantan) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Gebeng, bandar | UPI Bandar Gebeng 13/40 |
| Batu Yon, Hulu Jelai (Lipis) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Jelai, mukim | UPI Jelai 14/01–02; Hulu Jelai respelled Ulu Jelai |
| Telang | Kept under Lipis and added under Jelai | Two distinct mukims: Lipis 10 (Phg.733/2021) and Jelai 03 (Phg.520/2021) |
| Keratong (Rompin) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Muadzam Shah, mukim | UPI Muadzam 15/01 |
| Bebar | Kept under Pekan and added under Muadzam Shah | Two distinct mukims: Pekan 01 (Phg.845/1992) and Muadzam 02 (Phg.732/2021) |
| Muadzam Shah (Rompin) | Removed; town is two bandars now modelled | UPI Muadzam Shah I/II (15/40–41) added under the minor district |
| Kuala Krau (Jerantut) | Moved to Temerloh as Kuala Kerau, pekan | UPI Pekan Kuala Kerau 08/72; common spelling kept preferred |
| Teras (Raub) | Renamed Tras, mukim | UPI Mukim Tras 07/07; "Teras" is an upstream typo with zero gazette hits |
| Bandar Kuantan, Bandar Bera | Removed | Duplicates of the Kuantan bandar and Bera mukim rows |
| Dong, Sega (Lipis) | Removed | Wrong-district duplicates of Raub's mukims |
| Balok, Bukit Goh, Bukit Kuin, Sungai Lembing | Removed | Non-gazetted Kuantan towns/schemes inside a mukim |
| Damak, Sungai Koyan, Chini, Kemayan | Removed | Non-gazetted kampung/FELDA localities |
| Bandar Pusat Jengka, Bandar Tun Abdul Razak, Lurah Bilut | Removed | Non-gazetted towns (Jengka rows duplicated one renamed town) |

Postal links were repointed to the surviving mukim, pekan, or district rows;
no postcode lost its primary link.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 12 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Balok (26080/26190 only; 26100/26150 are Kuantan city codes), Bukit
Goh, Sungai Lembing, Bandar Tun Abdul Razak (corrected to the Muadzam Shah
minor district), Lurah Bilut (corrected to Bentong), Chini, Bandar Bera,
Kemayan, Bandar Pusat Jengka (corrected to Maran; 27080 stays Jerantut),
Damak, Kuala Krau (corrected to Temerloh), and Sungai Koyan. Stay deleted:
Bukit Kuin (sub-locality), Muadzam Shah (duplicate of the I/II bandars), and
Hulu Jelai (admin entity, no postcode).

## Johor mukim audit

Every Johor subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Johor (Sept 2026). Retyped to bandar: Ayer Hitam, Bandar Penggaram,
Rengit, Senggarang, Yong Peng, Johor Bahru, Bandar Kluang, Bandar Kota
Tinggi, Bandar Mersing, Bandar Maharani, Batu Anam, Segamat, Bandar Kulai,
Bandar Tangkak. Retyped to pekan: Bukit Pasir, Pekan Nenas.

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Muar (Muar) | Renamed Bandar, kept mukim | UPI Mukim Bandar 06/02; town row is Bandar Maharani |
| Bandar Pontian | Renamed Pontian Kechil, bandar | UPI Bandar Pontian Kechil 07/41; Pontian Kechil is the town |
| Sungai Mati (Muar) | Moved to Tangkak, bandar | UPI Bandar Sungai Mati 22/43 |
| Bandar Johor Bahru, Bandar Segamat, Renggam, Gerisek, Seri Medan | Removed | Duplicates of the Johor Bahru bandar, Segamat bandar, Rengam, Grisek, and Sri Medan rows |
| Chaah (Kluang) | Removed | Wrong district; Chaah belongs to Segamat |
| Batu Pahat, Parit Raja, Parit Sulong, Semerah | Removed | Non-gazetted towns (town core is Bandar Penggaram) |
| Bandar Tiram, Gelang Patah, Iskandar Puteri, Masai, Pasir Gudang, Ulu Choh, Ulu Tiram | Removed | Non-gazetted JB towns/corridors inside a mukim |
| Divisyen Bandaraya | Removed | Not a place at all; an MBJB assessment-division label |
| Simpang Renggam, Bandar Penawar | Removed | Non-gazetted towns inside a mukim |
| Ayer Tawar 2, Pulau Satu | Removed | Wrong-district camp/island locality, non-gazetted |
| Endau (Mersing) | Removed | Non-gazetted town; the only gazetted Endau is Pahang's Mukim Endau |
| Bukit Gambir, Pagoh, Kukup | Removed | Non-gazetted towns/villages (Bukit Gambir is in Tangkak) |
| Bandar Tenggara, Gugusan Taib Andak | Removed | Non-gazetted FELDA schemes (Bandar Tenggara is in Kota Tinggi) |

UPI spelling variants are stored as alternative names (Nyior, Ulu Sungei
Sedili Besar, Sungei Pinggan, Renggam, Gerisek, Bandar Pontian). Postal
links were repointed to the surviving mukim, bandar, pekan, or district
rows; duplicate same-area links created by the merges were collapsed.

Two-hierarchy relocation pilot: 21 of the removed towns were reinstated as
postal `locality` rows under the two-hierarchy rule (postcode + official
recognition required; relocate, don't delete). Reinstated: Gelang Patah,
Iskandar Puteri, Masai, Pasir Gudang, Ulu Tiram, Ulu Choh (corrected to
Kulai), Gugusan Taib Andak, Bandar Tenggara and Ayer Tawar 2 (both corrected
to Kota Tinggi), Bandar Penawar, Kukup, Endau, Parit Raja, Parit Sulong,
Semerah, Renggam and Simpang Rengam (towns distinct from Mukim Rengam),
Pekan Chaah (corrected to Segamat), Pagoh, Bukit Gambir (corrected to
Tangkak), and Gerisek (town within Mukim Grisek). Bandar Tiram (quarter of
Ulu Tiram), Divisyen Bandaraya (non-place label), Bandar Pontian (alias of
Pontian Kechil), and Pulau Satu (Forest City island, no own postcode) stay
deleted. Each town's postcodes link it as primary with the covering admin
areas kept as secondary links.

Scope expansion: Tongkang Pechah and Parit Yaani were added as Batu Pahat
postal `locality` rows (external town lists name both, and addresses place
them under 83010). They share 83010 with the town core, so they link it as
secondary with Bandar Penggaram staying primary — the same pattern as Ulu
Choh sharing 81550 with Gelang Patah. (Renggam town is the opposite case:
86300 is its own code, so the town is primary there.)

Johor sweep (shared-postcode secondaries, primaries untouched): Skudai
(JB, 81300), Saleng (Kulai, 81400 shared with Senai), Kelapa Sawit (Kulai,
81000/81030 shared with Bandar Kulai), Chamek (Kluang, 86600 shared with
Paloh). Skipped for weak evidence: Sedili and Teluk Sengat (no distinct
town postcode), Seelong/Sengkang/Ayer Bemban (no postcode evidence),
Kangkar Pulai (ambiguous district), Taman Universiti and Mengkibol
(sub-localities of Skudai/Kluang).

Johor sweep, batch 2: Tanjung Agas (Tangkak, 84000 shared cross-district
with Muar town core). Muar, Segamat, Pontian, and Mersing needed no
additions — every listed town already has a row. Skipped: Bukit Naning and
Bukit Siput (suburbs), Kampung Tengah (85000 suburb), Jagoh, Sungai Karas,
Kayu Ara Pasong, Sanglang, Teluk Sengat, Sagil (village-level, no town
postcode evidence), Gemas Baharu (weak evidence), Pontian Besar (covered by
Mukim Pontian), Pekan Air Panas (likely Labis alias), Air Papan (village),
Segamat Baru (township), Permas (unreliable listing; Permas Jaya is JB).

Melaka sweep: Lubok China (Alor Gajah) added as a postal `locality` —
own post office and postcode 78100, so it takes primary with the district
placeholder demoted to secondary. All other Melaka towns already have rows.

Negeri Sembilan sweep: Telok Kemang (Port Dickson, federal constituency,
71050 shared with Si Rusa) added as a secondary-link `locality`. Gemas
town stays covered by Mukim Gemas. Seremban suburbs without rows (Sikamat,
Mambau, Paroi, Lobak, Rahang) deliberately skipped as sub-localities of
the town core.

Kedah sweep: Tikam Batu (Kuala Muda, federal-gazette post office, 08700
shared with Jeniang) added as a secondary-link `locality`. Guar Chempedak
already covered as Bandar Guar Cempedak (gazette spelling). Skipped:
Simpang Kuala (Alor Setar suburb), Tanjung Dawai (fishing village, no
town postcode evidence), Sungai Lalang / Sintok / Napoh (no verified
postcode evidence yet), Naka (village-level).

Perlis sweep: Kangar (01000), Padang Besar (02100), Kaki Bukit (02200),
and Simpang Empat (02700) added as state-parented `locality` rows, each
taking primary on its own code with the covering mukim demoted to
secondary. Arau and Kuala Perlis stay covered by their mukim rows.

Penang sweep: Teluk Bahang (Barat Daya, DUN, 11050 shared cross-district
with Bandar George Town), Batu Kawan (SPS, 14100 shared with Simpang
Ampat), and Bertam (SPU, DUN, 13200 shared with Kepala Batas) added as
secondary-link `locality` rows. Skipped: Bukit Minyak, Juru, Seberang
Jaya, Mak Mandin, Sungai Dua, Tanjung Bungah, Paya Terubong, and Sungai
Bakap (suburbs/sub-localities).

Kelantan sweep: Kok Lanas (Kota Bharu, 16450 shared with Ketereh) added
as a secondary-link `locality`. Skipped for lack of verified postcode
evidence: Pengkalan Kubor, Gual Ipoh, Bukit Bunga (in Jeli district, not
Tanah Merah).

Terengganu sweep: no additions — Chukai and Jerteh are already covered
as Bandar Cukai and Jertih (UPI spellings) with primaries on 24000 and
22000. All other listed towns have rows. Skipped: Seberang Takir (no
verified postcode evidence), Gong Badak (KT suburb), Penarik (fishing
village).

Pahang sweep: Bukit Tinggi (Bentong, 28750 shared with Bentong) and
Mengkarak (Bera, 28200 shared with Bandar Bera) added as secondary-link
`locality` rows. Genting Highlands already covered as Bandar Genting with
the 69000 primary. Skipped: Kampung Raja and Tanjung Gemok (no verified
postcode evidence); Janda Baik, Tekek, Tringkap, Kuala Semantan, Teriang,
Kerayong, Nenasi, Merchong (village-level).

Perak sweep: Simpang Lima (Kerian, 34200 shared with Parit Buntar) added
as a secondary-link `locality`. Trolak already covered as Terolak (UPI
spelling) with the 35700 primary; Tanjung Piandang already covered as
Mukim Tanjong Piandang. Skipped: Ayer Kuning, Bukit Merah, Lubuk Merbau,
Salak (no verified postcode evidence); Ampang and Tanjung Rambutan
(Ipoh suburbs).

Selangor sweep: Seri Kembangan (43300) and Serdang (43400) added as
Petaling `locality` rows taking primaries from district placeholders;
Balakong (Hulu Langat, 43300 shared cross-district) added secondary.
Tanjung Sepat already covered as Tanjong Sepat (UPI spelling).
Skipped: Sijangkang and Sungai Air Tawar (no clean postcode evidence —
conflicting codes for the latter); Batang Berjuntai (Bestari Jaya
alias); Setia Alam (township); Klang Valley suburbs and townships as a
class (USJ, Sunway, Puchong Jaya, Kinrara, and the like).

Sabah sweep: no additions — towns live as level-4 `subdistrict` rows and
every checked town (Kundasang, Tamparuli, Kiulu, Donggongon, Kinarut,
Benoni, Kimanis, Bongawan, Menumbok, Melalap, Kemabong, Sindumin,
Apin-Apin, Bingkor, Tungku, Sukau, Bukit Garam, Matunggong, Tandek) has
one. Skipped: Lok Kawi, Sikuati, Kanibongan (no verified postcode
evidence).

Sarawak sweep: no additions — same level-4 `subdistrict` pattern covers
every checked town (Sematan, Engkilili, Debak, Spaoh, Roban, Bintangor,
Niah, Batu Niah, Bekenu, Oya, Balingian, Sundar, Trusan, Sadong Jaya).
Skipped: Bako (fishing village).

WP sweep: no additions — KL's 11 parliamentary `locality` rows plus 7
mukims, Putrajaya's precincts, and Labuan's 28 kampung `locality` rows
already model each territory. KL neighborhoods (Bangsar, Mont Kiara,
and the like) deliberately skipped as sub-localities.

## Perlis

Perlis has no districts (`TIADA DAERAH`) and exactly 22 mukims, all already
bundled with exact names. Verified clean against the JUPEM UPI book; no
changes. Bandar Arau, Bandar Kangar, Pekan Kuala Perlis, and Pekan Kaki
Bukit exist but have no rows (missing entities are not added).

## Melaka mukim audit

Every Melaka subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Melaka (Sept 2026). Retyped to bandar: Melaka, Bandar Jasin, Bandar Alor
Gajah. Retyped to pekan: Asahan, Bemban. Same-name mukim/town duals keep
the mukim row and the town entity stays unlisted (missing entities are not
added): Merlimau, Kuala Sungai Baru, Sungai Rambai, Ayer Molek, Batu
Berendam, and the other Melaka Tengah duals. Removed: the
Bandaraya Melaka city-status label, both Ayer Keroh town rows (non-gazetted;
postcode 75450 spans Bukit Katil and Bukit Baru, so it links the district),
the Alor Gajah town duplicate, and the wrong-district Alor Gajah Asahan row
(Asahan town is Jasin's Pekan Asahan — the error came from its Alor Gajah
parliamentary seat). Kept on gazette evidence despite UPI naming quirks:
Ayer Pa'abas (UPI 03/01) and Sungai Baru Tengah (2004/2006 gazettes; UPI
shortens it to plain Sungei Baru).

Two-hierarchy relocation: Ayer Keroh town (75450) returned as a postal
`locality` row under Melaka Tengah; the Jasin Ayer Keroh row stays deleted
as a misfile.

## Penang mukim audit

Every Penang subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Pulau Pinang (Sept 2026), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia kod-mukim,
DOSM census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records. Retyped to
bandar (14): Bukit Mertajam, Perai, Butterworth, Kepala Batas, Nibong Tebal,
Air Itam, Bandar George Town, Batu Ferringhi, Gelugor, Jelutong, Tanjong
Bungah, Bukit Bendera (renamed from Penang Hill; gazetted Bandar Bukit
Bendera), Balik Pulau, Bayan Lepas. The island shares one mukim sequence:
Barat Daya is Mukim 1-12 plus Mukim A-J, Timur Laut is Mukim 13-18; Seberang
Perai Utara genuinely skips Mukim 15, so that row was removed. Removed 14
rows: non-gazetted town/area names (Permatang Pauh, Seberang Jaya, Kubang
Semang, Penaga, Tasek Gelugor, Simpang Ampat, Sungai Jawi, Batu Maung, Teluk
Kumbar), the state-name Pulau Pinang row (its George Town city postcodes move
to Bandar George Town), the USM institution row (11800 moves to Gelugor), the
SPU Mukim 15 gap row, and the Bandar Bukit Mertajam / Bandar Butterworth
duplicates. Postcodes remap to the true numbered mukim (Kubang Semang is SPT
Mukim 5, a district correction); Sungai Jawi straddles SPS Mukim 6+7 so 14200
links the district.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 8 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Permatang Pauh, Kubang Semang (corrected to SPT), Penaga, Tasek
Gelugor, Batu Maung, Teluk Kumbar (11920 only; 11950 is Bayan Lepas),
Simpang Ampat, and Sungai Jawi. Stay deleted: Penang Hill (11300 is George
Town), USM (11800 is Gelugor, plus a facility), Seberang Jaya (13700 is
Perai), and SPU Mukim 15 (no gazette evidence; genuinely skipped).

## Terengganu mukim audit

Every Terengganu subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary
book for Terengganu (Sept 2026), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia kod-mukim,
DOSM census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records. Retyped to
bandar: Kuala Terengganu, Dungun, Cukai (renamed from Chukai). Retyped to
pekan: Marang, Jertih (renamed from Jerteh). Renamed to gazetted forms with
common names kept as alternatives: Hulu Cukai, Kemasik, Kertih, Mercang,
Pengkalan Nangka. Kept against a narrow UPI read on wider evidence: Kuala
Abang (UPI truncates it to Abang; PLANMalaysia, DOSM, and gazettes agree on
Kuala Abang) and Caluk (canonical over the Chalok duplicate, which was
removed). Removed 12 rows: non-gazetted towns Paka, Bukit Besi, Bandar
Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, Ceneh, Ajil, Permaisuri, Bandar Permaisuri, Penarik;
wrong-district Ketengah Jaya (Dungun's Mukim Rasau), Sungai Tong (Setiu's
Mukim Hulu Nerus), and Bukit Payong (Marang's Mukim Bukit Payung, spelling
corrected in the move); and the Chalok duplicate of Caluk. Postcodes remap to
the gazetted mukim each town falls in.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 11 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Bukit Payong (corrected to Marang), Ceneh (24060 only; 24050 is Air
Putih), Kerteh, Ketengah Jaya (corrected to Dungun), Al-Muktafi Billah
Shah, Bukit Besi, Paka, Ajil, Sungai Tong (corrected to Setiu), Permaisuri
(the Bandar Permaisuri pair merged into one row), and Chalok (postal
spelling, distinct from Mukim Caluk). Stay deleted: Chukai (duplicate of
Bandar Cukai) and Penarik (no own postcode).

## Perak mukim audit

Every Perak subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Perak (Sept 2026; 13 districts), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia
kod-mukim, DOSM census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records.
Structural fixes: the combined Larut-Matang-dan-Selama district row was split
into Larut Matang (15 rows) and Selama (3 rows); Sungai Sumun moved from
Hilir Perak to Bagan Datuk; Trolak moved from Batang Padang to Muallim as
Pekan Terolak. Ipoh town split into Bandar Ipoh (N) and Bandar Ipoh (S) with
all 112 town postcodes linking the Kinta district (Muadzam precedent; the
N/S line runs east-west across the town centre per plan PW 5296). Retyped 17
rows to bandar and 12 to pekan (Langkap and Malim Nawar kept as pekan on
gazette evidence). Renamed to gazetted forms: Kelian Intan, Simpang Empat,
Terung (Terong/Trong are the same place), Hulu Ijok, Hulu Selama, Jaya Baru,
Pasir Panjang Hulu, Sayung, Sungai Raya, Hulu Bernam Barat. Removed 23 rows:
7 non-gazetted towns (Behrang Stesen, Seri Manjung, Kampung Kepayang, Jeram,
Sauk, Enggor, Ulu Bernam), the TLDM Lumut base row (32100 to Lumut), 9
wrong-district rows (Changkat Jering, Slim, Slim River, Belanja, Kampar, Teja,
Tronoh, Rantau Panjang, Batu Kurau), 5 spelling duplicates (Bruas, Bagan
Datoh, Ulu Kinta, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Trong of Terung), and Ipoh town
(split into N/S bandars). Uncertain
postcodes link the district: 36500 (Ladang Ulu Bernam estate) to Hilir Perak,
31750 to Kinta, 34140 to Selama, 34850 to Larut Matang.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 11 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Kampung Kepayang, Trong, Seri Manjung, Behrang Stesen (corrected to
Muallim), Changkat Jering (corrected to Larut-Matang), Enggor, Jeram
(corrected to Kinta), Sauk, Tronoh (corrected to Kampar; 31750 moves off
Kinta district), Rantau Panjang (corrected to Selama), and Ulu Kinta
(postal spelling, distinct from Mukim Hulu Kinta). Stay deleted: Sungai
Raia (shares 31300), Terong (variant), the TLDM Lumut base (facility),
Simpang Ampat Semanggol and Trolak (duplicates of Pekan Simpang Empat and
Pekan Terolak), Saiong (mukim variant), Intan (Kelian Intan short form),
and Ulu Bernam (split/shared codes).

## Kedah mukim audit

Every Kedah subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Kedah (Sept 2026), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia kod-mukim, DOSM
census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records. Retyped 17 rows to
bandar and 5 to pekan. Renamed to gazetted forms: Gunung, Changlun, Hosba,
Kurung Hitam, Guar Cempedak. Moved 3 rows to the correct district: Kepala
Batas and Kodiang from Kota Setar to Kubang Pasu (both bandar), Jeniang from
Sik to Kuala Muda as Pekan Jeniang (gazetted 2009 from Mukim Gurun; 08700
follows the move while 08320 links Sik's Mukim Jeneri). Removed 5 rows: the
Kota Setar and Langkawi district-name rows (Langkawi town postcodes move to
Kuah), the UUM institution row, Yan Kechil locality (06910 secondary moves
to Sungai Daun), and Bukit Paya (a PLANMalaysia typo for Mukim Bukit Raya).

## Kelantan mukim audit

Every Kelantan subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Kelantan (Sept 2026), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia kod-mukim, DOSM
census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records. Retyped to bandar:
Kota Bharu, Baru Kubang Kerian (renamed from Kubang Kerian), Pasir Mas, Tanah
Merah. Retyped Mulong to pekan. Moved Melor from Bachok to Kota Bharu.
Removed 14 rows: the Bandar Kota Bharu duplicate (93 town postcodes move to
Kota Bharu), non-gazetted Daerah/penghulu names (Chiku, Dabong x2, Galas, Olak
Jeram, Ayer Lanas, Bandar Baru Tunjong, Ketereh, Panji), the Kem Desa Pahlawan
camp row (16500 to the district; 16450 spans mukims so it links the district
too), the false Bandar Jeli row (Jeli has no gazetted bandar; 17600/17700 go
to Mukim Jeli), the Bachok Cherang Ruku duplicate, and the Betis duplicate of
Kuala Betis. 18200 Dabong links Mukim Kuala Stong on land-title evidence.

Two-hierarchy relocation: 3 removed towns returned as postal `locality`
rows — Ketereh (16450), Dabong (18200, Kuala Krai; the Gua Musang row stays
deleted as a misfile), and Ayer Lanas (17700). Stay deleted: Bandar Baru
Tunjong (township sharing Kota Bharu codes), the Kem Desa Pahlawan camp
(facility), Panji, Olak Jeram, Chiku, and Galas (no own postcode), and
Bandar Jeli (the town's name is exactly Mukim Jeli's, so it is covered).

## Negeri Sembilan mukim audit

No JUPEM UPI book is published for Negeri Sembilan, so every subdivision row
was diffed against the PLANMalaysia kod-mukim inventory (2021) with each
verdict corroborated by state gazettes, DOSM-coded lists, or land titles.
Retyped 5 rows to bandar and 10 to pekan. Moved Tanjong Ipoh from Jelebu to
Kuala Pilah as a pekan. Renamed to gazetted forms: Baru Enstek, Serting Hulu,
Sepri. Removed Seremban 2 (housing scheme in Mukim Rasah) and Pusat Bandar
Palong (FELDA cluster centre; postcodes move to Mukim Rompin). Kept on
gazette evidence against PLANMalaysia typos: Titian Bintangor (not Bintagor),
Keru (not Kebu), Tebong of Tampin (not Tenong; distinct from Melaka's Tebong).

Two-hierarchy relocation: Pusat Bandar Palong (73430-73470, own post
office) returned as a postal `locality` row; Seremban 2 stays deleted (70300
is Seremban).

## Sabah audit

Sabah has no gazetted mukim tier, so every subdivision row was verified
against Sabah state gazettes, the SPR polling-district gazette, DOSM census
divisions, district-office mukim lists, and council records. Added the Paitan
and Sook districts (gazetted 2024). Moved Jambongan from Beluran to Paitan,
Nangoh from Beluran to Telupid, and Dalit from Keningau to Sook. Removed 8
rows: stale pre-split district duplicates (Paitan, Tongod, Nabawan, Sook,
Tambunan), the Libaran parliament/island ambiguity, the Wallace Bay water
feature, and the Cenderawasih FELDA postal town (91150 moves to Lahad Datu
district). Renamed to official forms: Gum-Gum, Bum-Bum, Sepulot.

Two-hierarchy relocation: Cenderawasih (91150, own post office) returned as
a level-4 postal `locality` row; the remaining removals stay deleted as
duplicates or non-places.

## Sarawak audit

Sarawak has no mukim tier; the daerah kecil is the formal subdistrict tier,
so every row was verified against the Administrative Areas Order 2022
gazette, the 2018 admin table plus 2021/22 upgrade notices, the SPR
polling-district gazette, and DOSM townships. Moved 9 rows: Tapah to Siburan,
Moyan and Tambirat to Asajaya, Triso to Pusa, Roban to Kabong, Nanga Medamit
to Limbang, Belawai to Tanjung Manis, Paloh to Daro, and Niah to Subis.
Removed 13 rows: stale post-split duplicates (Balingian, Bekenu, Long Lama,
Lingga, Kabong, Sebauh, Tatau, Entabai), the Kuala Balingian duplicate, the
Pusat Mel Miri mail centre (98070 moves to Miri), the Baram region name
(Marudi postcodes move to Marudi), the Poyut/Nibong conflated name, and the
Sebelak river name. Renamed Budu to the official Nanga Budu form.

## Singapore

The bundled `SingaporeGeographyProvider` supplies the five ISO 3166-2 CDC
districts as `State` rows, the URA planning tree (5 regions, 55 planning
areas), and the postal tree (28 districts, 81 sectors; sector `74` is
unallocated). The postal hierarchy is `postal district → postal sector`; the
administrative hierarchy is `planning region → planning area`. It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('SG')` after countries are seeded.

CDC districts, URA regions, and postal districts are three independent
first-level partitions: a CDC district is never the parent of a planning area
or a postal sector. `State` rows link to matching district areas without a
hierarchy type so the bridge resolves them for any hierarchy. The
independence is structural, not a gap: CDC boundaries follow electoral
divisions (GRCs/SMCs), which cut across planning areas and regions — four of
the five CDCs overlap the Central Region alone — so no CDC nesting is
modeled and no `refinedBy` is declared.

Revisit record: the postal tree was verified link by link (all 81 sector →
district links, sector `74` unallocated, no sector `83`) and the planning
tree name by name (all 55 areas with region parents: 22 Central, 6 East, 8
North, 7 North-East, 12 West). Singapore intentionally has no postal
`locality` level: postcodes are building-level, so towns have no single
postcode, and HDB towns already coincide with planning areas. The pins live
in `SingaporeGeographyProviderTest`.

Individual six-digit postcodes are intentionally not bundled. Every building
in Singapore has its own postcode, so the dataset is SingPost-scale. Resolve
operational postcodes on demand with `ResolveSingaporePostalCodesAction`,
which queries SLA's OneMap API and caches the results in `postal_codes` with
sector links. Use the bundled postal sectors (the first two postcode digits)
for area-level grouping. OneMap data requires attribution to OneMap/SLA in
applications that display it.

Singapore addresses are formatted as street lines followed by
`Singapore NNNNNN`. State and city lines are omitted when they are empty or
just repeat `Singapore`; a distinctive town value is kept on its own line.

## Indonesia

The bundled `IndonesiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 38 ISO 3166-2
provinces as `State` rows and one administrative hierarchy: 38 provinces →
514 regencies/cities → 7,285 districts. Area codes are the official
Kemendagri codes (2/4/6 digits) and `source_id` values embed them
(`id:province:11`, `id:regency:1101`, `id:district:110101`). It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ID')` after countries are seeded.

The area tree is derived from
[lokabisa-oss/region-id v1.0.1](https://github.com/lokabisa-oss/region-id/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
(MIT), keeping official names, codes, and parent links. Two province names
differ from that source so areas match the seeded states: `DKI Jakarta`
(source: `Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta`, the pre-2024 legal name) and `DI
Yogyakarta` (source: `Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta`, kept as an alias). The
current legal name `Daerah Khusus Jakarta` is also aliased.

Villages and urban villages (83,762 desa/kelurahan, level 4) ship as an
opt-in dataset in `indonesia-villages.csv`, from the same upstream release.
Set `addressing.geography.indonesia.villages` to `true`
(`ADDRESSING_INDONESIA_VILLAGES`) to seed them; the default seed stops at
districts. Seeded villages carry the `village` role, matching the level's
assignment role.

Cascade labels use the national terms (`Kecamatan`, `Desa`,
`Kelurahan`, `Kota`) with special-autonomy overrides: `Gampong` in
Aceh (Law 11/2006, regencies and cities), `Nagari` in West Sumatra
(rural only — municipalities stay kelurahan), `Kapanewon` /
`Kemantren` + `Kalurahan` in Yogyakarta (Perda DIY), and `Distrik` /
`Kampung` in the six Papua provinces (Otsus Law 21/2001). Deep areas
link their province ancestor directly, like the Malaysia provider.

ISO 3166-2 defines seven Indonesian geographical units (island groups such
as `ID-JW` Jawa) alongside the 38 provinces. Those units are not provinces
and were removed from the bundled state data; `seed()` also deletes any
stragglers from databases seeded before that fix, so `Papua` always resolves
to the province. Nusantara/IKN is a separate capital authority, not a 39th
province.

Individual five-digit postcodes are intentionally not bundled; import
operational postcodes through `ImportPostalCodesAction`. There is no postal
hierarchy and no `refinedBy`: the single administrative chain
province → regency/city → district → village already scopes every level,
and villages are administrative rows rather than postal localities.

Revisit record: all 38 province codes verified against ISO 3166-2:ID, every
province's regency/city split reconciled (416 + 98), and all 91,599 rows
checked for dangling parents and Kemendagri code shape with zero violations.
Known lag: BPS counts 7,288 districts (2025) and 84,048 villages (2024)
against the bundled 7,285 and 83,762 — upstream `lokabisa-oss/region-id`
has no release newer than v1.0.1, so refresh when it does rather than
hand-patching rows.

Indonesian addresses are formatted as street lines, `kelurahan`/`desa` and
`kecamatan` components, `{kota} {postcode}`, province, and country, per the
UPU addressing layout.

## Brunei

The bundled `BruneiGeographyProvider` supplies the four ISO 3166-2
districts as `State` rows and one administrative hierarchy: 4 districts →
39 mukims (18 in Brunei-Muara, 8 each in Belait and Tutong, 5 in
Temburong). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BN')` after countries are seeded.

Mukim names follow Brunei government spellings (`Pengkalan Batu`, with
`Pangkalan Batu` aliased). Bruneian postcodes are six characters — two
uppercase letters (district, then mukim) followed by four digits — but no
complete public dataset exists, so postcodes are intentionally not bundled.
Import operational villages and postcodes through `AddressAreaSource` and
`ImportPostalCodesAction`.

Brunei addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, kampung
component, `{town or district} {postcode}` with the town preferred, and
country. Types are labelled `Daerah` and `Mukim`.

## Bahrain

The bundled `BahrainGeographyProvider` supplies the four ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows (codes `13`, `14`, `15`, `17` — there is no
`16` since the Central Governorate was abolished in 2014) and a
single-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BH')` after countries are seeded.

Bahraini addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{municipality} {postcode}` with a 3–4 digit postcode, and country.

## Qatar

The bundled `QatarGeographyProvider` supplies the eight municipalities
as `State` rows with 90 census zones as level-2 areas (57 Doha, 10 Al
Rayyan, 7 Al Wakrah, 7 Al Sheehaniya, 3 Al Khor, 3 Al Shamal, 2 Al
Daayen, 1 Umm Salal) in a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('QA')` after
countries are seeded. Zone numbers run 1–98 with 8, 9, 10, 11, 59, 87,
88, 89 unassigned; zones 50/57/58 sit in Doha, 69 in Al Daayen, and
96/97 in Al Rayyan, so filter by parent rather than assuming
contiguous ranges. Official PSA district names are kept as `official`
aliases; repeated district names across zones (Al Thumama ×3, Nuaija
×3, Al Bidda, Mushaireb, Old Al Ghanim, Fereej Bin Mahmoud, Onaiza,
Doha International Airport ×2 each) share names by design; filter by
code.

Municipality names use official English spellings (`Al Sheehaniya`,
`Al Shamal`, `Doha`); the ISO names `Ad Dawhah` and `Madinat ash
Shamal` are kept as aliases. Qatar has no postcode system — delivery
is by P.O. Box or zone/street — so the formatter stacks street lines,
city, and country with no postcode line.

## Kuwait

The bundled `KuwaitGeographyProvider` supplies the six ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows with 135 postal areas as level-2 areas
(32 Capital, 29 Ahmadi, 24 Jahra, 20 Farwaniya, 17 Hawalli, 13 Mubarak
Al-Kabeer) in a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('KW')` after countries are seeded.
Uninhabited islands (Miskan, Umm an Namil, Bubiyan, Warbah) are excluded;
blocks and per-area postcodes stay out of scope, and governorate/area
name twins (Farwaniya, Ahmadi, Jahra, Hawalli, Mubarak Al-Kabeer) share
names by design; filter by type.

Kuwaiti addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode left of the locality,
and country. The `governorate` type is labelled `Muhafaza`.

## Jordan

The bundled `JordanGeographyProvider` supplies the twelve ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(`governorate` > `liwa`). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('JO')` after countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries the 51 districts (liwa) from DOS Statistical Yearbook
2024 Table 2.4: Amman 9, Irbid 9, Karak 7, Balqa 5, Mafraq 4, Ma'an 4,
Zarqa 3, Tafilah 3, Ajloun 2, Aqaba 2, Madaba 2, Jerash 1. Canonical
names follow DOS romanization except where the shipped L1 spellings
already differ (Ajloun, Tafilah, Jerash, Deir Alla, Naour, Mahis and
Fuhais); DOS forms are kept as `official` aliases and
English-Wikipedia/citypopulation/PCGN spellings (Al-Quwairah, Shoubak,
Husseiniya, Kufrinjah, Wadi Al Seer, Aii, Faqou', Ruwayshid,
Quwaysimah, Jizeh, Mowaqqar, Hashimiyya) as `alternative` aliases.
DOS publishes no liwa codes, so L2 rows carry no `code`. Qada
(sub-districts) are out of scope and do not ship.

Jordanian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country.
Types are labelled `Muhafaza` and `Liwa`.

## Oman

The bundled `OmanGeographyProvider` supplies the eleven ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(governorate → 63 wilayats). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('OM')` after countries are seeded.

Omani addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, a
3-digit postcode on its own line above the locality, and country.
The `governorate` type is labelled `Muhafaza`.

## United Arab Emirates

The bundled `UnitedArabEmiratesGeographyProvider` supplies the seven
emirates as `State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy.
It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AE')`
after countries are seeded.

The UAE has no postcode system — delivery is to P.O. Boxes only — so
the formatter stacks street lines, city, and country with no postcode
line.

## Saudi Arabia

The bundled `SaudiArabiaGeographyProvider` supplies the thirteen ISO
3166-2 regions as `State` rows (codes `01`–`12` and `14`; there is no
region `13`) and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('SA')` after
countries are seeded.
The 139 governorates ship as level-2 areas under their regions.

Saudi addresses are formatted per the UPU home-delivery layout:
street lines, a 5-digit postcode on its own line above the locality,
and country. Short addresses (`RAGI2929` style) and the separate P.O.
Box layout are not generated.

## Ecuador

The bundled `EcuadorGeographyProvider` supplies the 24 provinces
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('EC')` after
countries are seeded.
The 222 cantons ship as level-2 areas under their provinces.

Ecuadorian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street
lines, `{postcode} - {locality}` with a 6-digit postcode, and
country. Types are labelled `Provincia` and `Cantón`.

The 1225-code overlay (010101–900004) comes from the GeoNames dump
at canton level covering all 222 cantons. The four zone-90 codes
for the former undelimited zones link their absorbing cantons
(El Piedrero to El Triunfo, Manga del Cura to El Carmen, Las
Golondrinas to Cotacachi, per referendum/decree records). No new
area rows.

## Egypt

The bundled `EgyptGeographyProvider` supplies the 27 ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('EG')` after countries are seeded.
The 365 districts ship as level-2 areas from the OCHA Common
Operational Dataset on Administrative Boundaries (CAPMAS
census geography, valid 21 April 2017), which carries a
p-code (`EG0401`-style) and an explicit governorate parent
per district. Rows mix urban qisms and rural marakiz (plus a
few police-administered units such as `Port Suez Police
Department`); same-named qism/markaz pairs (e.g. the two
`Luxor` rows) ship as separate parent-scoped rows. Names use
COD transliteration (`Suhag`, `Sharkia`, `Qina`).

Egyptian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
locality, governorate, a 7-digit postcode on its own line, and country.
Governorate and the generic district (mixed qism/markaz rows) need no
type labels; qism/markaz cannot split further because the COD table
carries no kind column.

## South Africa

The bundled `SouthAfricaGeographyProvider` supplies the nine ISO
3166-2 provinces as `State` rows and a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ZA')` after countries are seeded.
The 44 district and 8 metropolitan municipalities ship as level-2 areas under their provinces.

South African addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street
lines, locality, a 4-digit postcode below it, and country. The
province line is omitted when a postcode is present, per the UPU rule.

## Türkiye

The bundled `TurkiyeGeographyProvider` supplies the 81 ISO 3166-2
provinces as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(`province` > `district`). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('TR')` after countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries all 973 ilçeler. The 51 non-metropolitan provinces
each have a bare `Merkez` central district; the 30 metropolitan
provinces have multiple urban districts instead (no `Merkez` row).
The newest district is Derecik (Hakkâri), created in 2018 by Law 7148;
no district has been created since. Districts carry no `code`: no
official numeric ilçe code system was verified, so the column stays
empty. `Kazan` is kept as a `historic` alias (renamed Kahramankazan by
Law 6752 in 2016) and `Karadeniz Ereğli` as a `common` alias for
Zonguldak's `Ereğli`, which twins officially with Konya's `Ereğli`.
25 names twin across provinces (`Merkez` ×51, `Ereğli` ×2,
`Yenişehir` ×3, 22 pairs) — filter by `type` and parent, never by
name alone. YSK's qualified `{Province} Merkez` form is a YSK-table
convention, not the district name. Villages and neighbourhoods
(mahalle) are intentionally not bundled.

Turkish addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}/{province}` with a 5-digit postcode, and
country. Sub-locality postcode suffixes (`06050-01` style) are not
generated.

## Panama

The bundled `PanamaGeographyProvider` supplies the 10 provinces plus the
3 province-level comarcas (Guna Yala, Emberá, Ngäbe-Buglé) as `State`
rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PA')` after countries are seeded.
The 81 districts ship as level-2 areas under provinces and comarcas.

Panama has no postcode system: addresses are formatted per the UPU layout
with street lines, locality, and country. Rural PO-box style addresses
(`Zona 4, Apartado 0819-...)` keep the zone box in the street line.

## Paraguay

The bundled `ParaguayGeographyProvider` supplies the 17 departments plus
Asunción as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(department → 263 districts). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PY')` after countries are seeded.
Asunción is typed `capital_district` sharing the L1 level and `department`
assignment role, so it sits in the state tier with department grouping
rather than a standalone label.

Paraguayan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 4-digit postcode, and country.

## Uruguay

The bundled `UruguayGeographyProvider` supplies the 19 departments
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(department → 125 municipalities). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('UY')` after countries are seeded.

Uruguayan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} – {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode and en dash, the
department on its own line, and country.

## Venezuela

The bundled `VenezuelaGeographyProvider` supplies the 23 states
plus the Capital District and the Federal Dependencies (ISO code
`W`) as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(state → 335 municipalities). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('VE')` after countries are seeded.
The capital district shares the `state` assignment role; the
childless federal dependency keeps its own role. Libertador ships
under the capital district.

Venezuelan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with a 4-digit postcode (extended
`3028-A` style codes pass through), the state on its own line,
and country.

## Pakistan

The bundled `PakistanGeographyProvider` supplies the seven ISO 3166-2
subdivisions as `State` rows — four provinces plus the Islamabad
Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir
(`Azad Kashmir` is aliased) — and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(province/territory → 178 districts). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PK')` after countries are seeded.

Districts follow the mid-2026 reorganization state: Punjab counts 41
(`Taunsa` included; `Jampur` was announced in December 2022 but never
notified and stays excluded), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counts 40
(Chitral split into Lower/Upper plus `Central Dir`, `Paharpur`, and
`Upper Swat`), and Balochistan counts 42. The May 2026 Balochistan
batch (`Barshore`, `Tump`, Upper Dera Bugti, `Taftan`, `Wadh`, Quetta
East/West) supersedes the January Quetta City/Saddar notification and
is included; whole `Quetta` is retired by the East/West split and
`Karezat` stays removed (abolished 29 November 2022). Tehsils are
intentionally not bundled.

Pakistani addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality}-{postcode}` with a 5-digit dash-separated postcode, and
country.

## India

The bundled `IndiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 36 ISO 3166-2 states
and union territories as `State` rows (28 states, 8 union territories
including Ladakh and the merged Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and
Diu) and a two-level administrative hierarchy (`state` > `district`).
It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IN')` after
countries are seeded. State codes follow the 23 November 2023 ISO
amendment (`CG`, `OD`, `TS`, `UK`).

Level 2 carries 786 districts keyed by official LGD code
(`in:district:<lgd-code>`, LGD snapshot 31 May 2026): all 784 LGD rows
plus Mahe (599) and Yanam (601), which LGD dropped in 2024–25 but which
remain official Puducherry districts with Census 2011 codes 636/634.
Names follow current official spellings, including the January 2026
Delhi reorganisation (Shahdara dissolved; Old Delhi, Central North,
Outer North added), Kushavati, Hansi, Markapuram, Polavaram, Vav-Tharad,
Meluri, Sribhumi, Ahilyanagar, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Dharashiv,
Bengaluru South and Narmadapuram, with former and LGD-variant names kept
as aliases. Three cross-state twins exist (Bilaspur, Hamirpur,
Pratapgarh) — filter by `type` and parent, never by name alone.
Excluded for lack of LGD codes: the five Ladakh districts notified 27
April 2026, the announced-but-unnotified Kalyan Singh Nagar (UP), and
West Bengal's unimplemented announced seven. Tehsils/blocks (L3) are out
of scope.

Indian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
locality, state, a 6-digit postcode on its own line, and country.
Secondary postcodes (`834001-34` style) are intentionally not bundled.

## United Kingdom

The bundled `UnitedKingdomGeographyProvider` supplies the four nations
(England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) as areas in a
two-level administrative hierarchy. The 221 ISO 3166-2 subdivisions
remain global `State` rows only; they are not imported as areas. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('GB')` after
countries are seeded.
The 48 English ceremonial counties, 32 Scottish council areas, 22 Welsh principal areas and 11 Northern Ireland districts ship as level-2 areas under their nations.

British addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, post
town, the uppercased postcode on its own line, and country. The county
line is omitted when a postcode is present, per the UPU rule. Nation,
county, council area, county borough, and district need no type labels;
historic counties are intentionally not aliased (they map ambiguously
onto the current areas).

## Bangladesh

The bundled `BangladeshGeographyProvider` supplies the eight ISO
3166-2 divisions as `State` rows plus all 64 districts, with one
administrative hierarchy: 8 divisions → 64 districts (Dhaka 13,
Chattogram 11, Khulna 10, Rajshahi 8, Rangpur 8, Barishal 6, Sylhet 4,
Mymensingh 4). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BD')` after countries are seeded.

Names follow the post-2018 official English spellings (`Barishal`,
`Chattogram`, `Bogura`, `Jashore`, `Cumilla`, `Jhalakathi`,
`Netrokona`); seeding also corrects the matching global state rows.
Only divisions link to states; districts are assignable through the
`district` role with their division selected first.

The 1349-code overlay (1000–9461) comes from the GeoNames dump at
district level: all 64 districts covered, old-spelling admin2 names
mapped to the post-2018 spellings, GPO anchors verified. Office-level
codes link their district; no new area rows.

Bangladeshi addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
an optional `thana` component, `{locality} - {postcode}` with a
4-digit postcode, and country.

## Morocco

The bundled `MoroccoGeographyProvider` supplies the twelve ISO 3166-2
regions as `State` rows plus all 75 second-level divisions, with one
administrative hierarchy: 12 regions → 62 provinces + 13 prefectures.
It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MA')`
after countries are seeded.

Region names follow ISO (`Marrakech-Safi`, `Fès-Meknès`,
`Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceïma`, `L'Oriental`); the `(EH)` Western Sahara
annotations from the global source are stripped, and seeding corrects
the matching global state rows. Only regions link to states;
provinces and prefectures are assignable through the `province` role
with their region selected first.

Moroccan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode left of the locality,
and country. Types are labelled `Région`, `Préfecture`, and
`Province`.

## China

The bundled `ChinaGeographyProvider` supplies 33 provincial-level
divisions as `State` rows (22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4
municipalities, plus Hong Kong and Macao) and 333 prefecture-level
divisions (293 prefecture-level cities, 30 autonomous prefectures,
7 prefectures, 3 leagues) as `AddressArea` rows under a
province → prefecture hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('CN')` after countries are seeded.

Taiwan carries its own country code (`TW`) with its own postal
system, so it is intentionally not a CN area. Counties and districts
(level 3) are intentionally not bundled. The two Suzhou and two Fuzhou
prefecture-level cities carry province-disambiguated names
("Suzhou, Anhui" vs "Suzhou, Jiangsu").

Chinese addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, an
optional city/district line, `{postcode} {province}` with a 6-digit
postcode, and country.

## Russia

The bundled `RussiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 83 ISO 3166-2
federal subjects as `State` rows (46 oblasts, 21 republics, 9 krais,
4 okrugs, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and the Jewish Autonomous
Oblast) and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('RU')` after countries are
seeded.

Crimea, Sevastopol, and the territories claimed in 2022 are not
ISO-recognized subdivisions and are intentionally absent. Nenets is
typed as an okrug (the global snapshot mistypes it), and krai/okrug
names carry their suffixes per the UPU province list. Districts
(raions) are intentionally not bundled: the second tier spans
parallel administrative and municipal systems with no
consolidated per-subject source. The tier is parked pending
the GAR extract, not cancelled — see the
[Russia tier-2 research log](17-russia-tier2-research.md) for
the usage evidence, the rejected options, and the resume
checklist.

Russian addresses are formatted as street lines, locality, subject,
a 6-digit postcode, and country — country last, per the UPU IB
recommendation. Domestic Russian convention prints the postcode after
the country instead; the formatter deliberately deviates.

## Germany

The bundled `GermanyGeographyProvider` supplies the 16 Länder as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('DE')` after
countries are seeded.
The 401 districts ship as level-2 areas under their states, typed
`rural_district` (294) and `urban_district` (107) from the source
table's Form column and grouped under the shared `district` level
and role. Aachen, Hanover, and Saarbrücken ride with rural: they
hold a different statute (Kommunalverband besonderer Art) but are
Rural-form and district-level. Row keys keep the historical
`de:district:*` shape (twin cities take parent-scoped keys:
`de:district:bayern:munich` is the kreisfreie Stadt).

State names use German official forms (`Bayern`, `Sachsen`); the
seven common English exonyms (`Bavaria`, `Lower Saxony`, `North
Rhine-Westphalia`, `Rhineland-Palatinate`, `Saxony`, `Saxony-Anhalt`,
`Thuringia`) are kept as aliases.

German addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country. No `D-`
prefix is ever added. Types are labelled with the German terms
(`state` → `Land`, `rural_district` → `Landkreis`, `urban_district` →
`Kreisfreie Stadt`); none ever prints on mail, and the Stadtstaaten
need no per-state override.

## France

The bundled `FranceGeographyProvider` supplies the 18 regions (13
metropolitan, 5 overseas) as `State` rows in a two-level
administrative hierarchy. The 101 departments and overseas
collectivities remain global `State` rows only; they are not imported
as areas. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('FR')` after countries are seeded.
The 101 departments plus the Lyon Metropolis ship as level-2 areas under their regions.

French addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country. CEDEX
suffixes are not generated. Types are labelled `Région` and
`Département`; the 973 region row is the endonym `Guyane` (matching
the department row and the corrected states.json entry) with the
English `French Guiana` kept as an alias.

## Italy

The bundled `ItalyGeographyProvider` supplies the 20 regions as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IT')` after countries are seeded.
The 82 provinces, 15 metropolitan cities, 6 free consortiums, 4 decentralization entities and 2 autonomous provinces ship as level-2 areas under their regions.

Region names use Italian official forms (`Toscana`, `Sicilia`); the
eight common English exonyms (`Piedmont`, `Aosta Valley`, `Lombardy`,
`Trentino-South Tyrol`, `Tuscany`, `Apulia`, `Sicily`, `Sardinia`)
are kept as aliases.

Italian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality} {province}` with a 5-digit postcode, and
country. The two-letter province abbreviation comes from the optional
`province_code` address component and is omitted when absent. The
`region` type is labelled `Regione`; second-level sigla stay in the
code column (search aliases ship for state-level abbreviations only).

## Japan

The bundled `JapanGeographyProvider` supplies the 47 prefectures as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy (`prefecture` >
`municipality`). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('JP')` after countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries all 1,747 municipalities from the MIC R6.1.1 code table:
792 cities, 743 towns, 183 villages, the 23 Tokyo special wards (folded
in as municipalities), and the 6 Northern-Territories paper villages
(Shikotan, Tomari, Ruyobetsu, Rubetsu, Shana, Shibetoro — Japanese
claimed/notional rows under Hokkaido). Names use bare unmacroned
romanization (`Sapporo`, `Chiyoda`, `Naha`) with kanji in `native_name`;
rows are typed `city`/`town`/`village`/`ward` (792/743/189/23) from the
kanji suffix (市/町/村/区) and grouped under the shared `municipality`
level and role; row keys keep the historical `jp:municipality:*` shape.
Thirteen same-prefecture name twins exist (Tomari ×2 in
Hokkaido, Fuchu city/town in Hiroshima, Toshima ward/village in Tokyo,
and ten more) plus ~100 cross-prefecture twins (Date, Fuchu) — filter
by `code` and parent, never by name alone. Ordinance-designated-city
wards (e.g. Osaka's 24 ku) are sub-municipal and intentionally not
bundled. Level-2 names are validated mechanically against the MIC
table (code↔parent consistency, kind totals, twin coverage);
row-by-row external name verification of all 1,747 rows remains
future work.

Japanese addresses are formatted per the UPU western layout: street
lines, `{city}, {prefecture}`, and `{postcode} {country}` on the last
line — all three detailed UPU examples join code and country
(`231-0012 JAPAN`); the schematic's split lines are the outlier.
Prefecture, city, town, village, and ward need no type labels (the
accepted collective and kind terms).

## United States

The bundled `UnitedStatesGeographyProvider` supplies 56 states,
districts, and territories as `State` rows (50 states, the District
of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) with 3,143 counties and
county equivalents as level-2 areas in a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('US')` after countries are seeded.

Counties carry 5-digit FIPS GEOIDs and parent their state row, typed
by Census flavor (`county`, `parish`, `borough`, `census_area`,
`city` for the 38 Virginian plus Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson
City independents, `municipality` for Anchorage and Skagway, and
`planning_region` for Connecticut's 9 post-2022 regions). Puerto
Rico's municipios stay owned by the Puerto Rico provider and the
District of Columbia has no county child (it is its own
county-equivalent); both are intentionally absent here. County rows
come from the 2025 Census Gazetteer (public domain).

The military postal regions (`AA`, `AE`, `AP`) and the Minor Outlying
Islands (`UM`) are postal constructs, not addressable geography, and
are intentionally not areas.

American addresses are formatted per USPS Publication 28: street
lines, `{locality} {ST} {ZIP}` with the state abbreviation resolved
from a full-name map (already-abbreviated values pass through
uppercased), and country. All 56 states, territories, and DC carry
their USPS abbreviation as a searchable alias (the formatter map is
the source; military AA/AE/AP excluded with the areas). County
flavors need no type labels (parish, borough, and census_area render
correctly as distinct types).

## Spain

The bundled `SpainGeographyProvider` supplies the 17 autonomous
communities plus Ceuta and Melilla as `State` rows, with all 50
provinces, and one administrative hierarchy: 19 communities/cities →
50 provinces. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ES')` after countries are seeded.

Community names use short English forms (`Extremadura`, `Asturias`,
`Murcia`, `Madrid`) while provinces keep official local spellings
(`A Coruña`, `Bizkaia`, `Gipuzkoa`, `Araba`, `Ourense`, `Illes
Balears`). Only communities link to states; provinces are assignable
through the `province` role with their community selected first.

Spanish addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, the province on its
own line, and country. Community, city, and province need no type
labels (the community names are English exonyms by documented
convention, mirroring states.json).

## Poland

The bundled `PolandGeographyProvider` supplies the 16 voivodeships as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PL')` after
countries are seeded.
The 314 land counties and 66 city counties ship as level-2 areas under their voivodeships.

Voivodeship names use standard English exonyms (`Mazovia`, `Lesser
Poland`) since the official Polish forms are adjectives, not
standalone proper nouns. Powiats and gminas are intentionally not
bundled.

Polish addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with an `NN-NNN` postcode, and country.

## Netherlands

Councils (typed `area_council`, sharing the `lga` role). Names follow
the post-2023 gazetted forms from the Fifth Alteration (Afikpo, Edda,
Ghari, Yewa North/South, Atisbo, Obio-Akpor) with pre-2023 names kept
as `historic` aliases. `Aiyekire` keeps its constitutional spelling
with `Gbonyin` (state usage, preferred) and `Ayekire` as aliases; the
Barkin Ladi → Gwol rename failed in the Senate and is not applied.
Six cross-state twins exist (Obi, Bassa, Ifelodun, Irepodun, Surulere,
Nasarawa) — filter by `type` and parent, never by name alone.
State-created LCDAs (e.g. Lagos's 37) and the October 2025 NASS
state/LGA-creation talks are excluded: only gazetted LGAs ship.

Nigerian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,

Ethiopia). Seeding deletes any `SN` straggler rows, and the bundled
state data no longer ships the code. South Ethiopia (`SE`) and Central
Ethiopia (`CE`) have no ISO codes yet; those codes are provisional
and will be updated when ISO assigns them.

the 42,011 barangays as level-3 areas, all from the PSA
Philippine Standard Geographic Code 2025-2Q release (30 June
2025, used with acknowledgement per its use constraints; PSA
direct download is bot-walled so the build pulls a mirror of
the official files). NCR ships as a pseudo-province area mapped
to the existing region state, following PSGC's own model;
highly urbanized and independent cities parent to their
geographic province, the 8 Bangsamoro Special Geographic Area
municipalities to Cotabato, and Manila's 14 districts sit as
L2 siblings of Manila City (which is therefore barangay-less).
The other 16 regions stay global `State` rows only (with
`Bangsamoro` and `Cordillera Administrative Region` name
corrections at seed): regions are churny (ARMM→BARMM in 2019,
Negros Island Region re-created in 2024 without an ISO code),
while provinces are the address-relevant unit.
`Samar` keeps `Western Samar` as an alias.

Filipino addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
the municipality on its own line with `{postcode} {province}` below
it for provincial addresses (`{postcode} {municipality}, METRO MANILA`
for Metro Manila, `{postcode} {locality}` when no province is set),
and country.

## South Korea

The bundled `SouthKoreaGeographyProvider` supplies the 17
provincial-level divisions as `State` rows (9 provinces including the
special self-governing Gangwon State, Jeju, and Jeonbuk State — the
2023/2024 official renames, with `Gangwon` and `North Jeolla` aliased
— 6 metropolitan cities, Seoul, and Sejong) and a two-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('KR')` after countries are seeded.

The 77 cities, 82 counties and 69 autonomous districts ship as level-2 areas under their provinces and cities.

South Korean addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street
lines, `{province or city} {postcode}` with a 5-digit postcode, and
country.

## Taiwan

The bundled `TaiwanGeographyProvider` supplies the 22 divisions (6
special municipalities, 3 cities, 13 counties) as `State` rows and a
two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('TW')` after countries are seeded.

The 368 townships, county-administered cities, and districts ship
as level-2 areas with 8-digit household-registration codes and
Traditional Chinese native names (122 rural townships, 38 urban,
24 mountain indigenous townships, 14 county-administered cities,
164 districts, 6 mountain indigenous districts). All six types
share the `district` assignment role; 12 cross-division name
twins are parent-scoped. Villages (li) are not bundled.

Taiwanese addresses are formatted per Chunghwa Post (no UPU sheet is
published for Taiwan): street lines, `{locality} {postcode}` with the
6-digit 3+3 postcode, and country.

## Ukraine

The bundled `UkraineGeographyProvider` supplies the 24 oblasts plus
Kyiv, Sevastopol, and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as `State`
rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('UA')` after countries are seeded.

The 136 post-2020 raions ship as level-2 areas under their oblasts. Oblast names use
the ISO adjectival forms (`Kyivska`, `Lvivska`).

Ukrainian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
locality, oblast, a 5-digit postcode on its own line, and country.

## Iraq

The bundled `IraqGeographyProvider` supplies the 19 governorates as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IQ')` after
countries are seeded.

`Iqlim Kurdistan` is ISO-listed as a region (`IQ-KR`) overlapping
Erbil, Dohuk, Sulaymaniyah, and Halabja — not a governorate. Since
governorates are the address-relevant unit, seeding deletes any `KR`
straggler rows and the bundled state data no longer ships the code.
Halabja (governorate in Kurdistan since 2014, federally since April
2025) has no ISO code yet; `HL` follows UK government usage pending
ISO assignment. The 119 districts ship as level-2 areas under their governorates.

Iraqi addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{city}, {governorate}`, the 5-digit postcode on its own line, and
country. Types are labelled `Muhafaza` and `Qadaa`.

## Ghana

The bundled `GhanaGeographyProvider` supplies the 16 regions
(including the six created in 2019) as `State` rows and a
two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('GH')` after countries are seeded.
The 261 metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies ship as
level-2 areas under their regions (6 metropolitan + 113 municipal
+ 142 district).

Districts are intentionally not bundled.

Ghanaian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street or P.O.
Box lines, `{locality} {postcode}` (accepting both short and digital
`GA-183-8164` forms as given), the region on its own line, and
country.

## Angola

The bundled `AngolaGeographyProvider` supplies the 21 provinces
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AO')` after
countries are seeded.
The 326 post-reform municipalities ship as level-2 areas,
extracted from the 21 annexes of Law 14/24 itself (Diário da
República, 5 September 2024 — one map page per municipality,
titles parsed and counted to exactly 326). Names are
title-cased from the gazette's all-caps with Portuguese
particles kept lowercase; official spellings omit apostrophes
(`Mbanza Kongo`, `Nzeto`) per current government usage.

Law 14/24 (gazetted 5 Sept 2024) split Cuando Cubango into `Cuando`
and `Cubango`, carved `Icolo e Bengo` out of Luanda, and `Moxico
Leste` out of Moxico; the new provinces were formally instituted
with appointed governors in December 2024 and the 2024 census
tabulates all 21, so the bundled data tracks the 21 as operational.
The retired `Cuando Cubango` row is removed (a split has no single
successor to alias). ISO 3166-2:AO still lists only the former 18,
so the bundled codes `CUA`/`CUB`/`IEB`/`MLE` are provisional
pending ISO.

Angola has no postcode system, so the formatter stacks street lines,
city, and country with no postcode line. Types are labelled with the
Portuguese gazette terms (`province` → `Província`, `municipality` →
`Município`).

## Cameroon

The bundled `CameroonGeographyProvider` supplies the 10 regions as
`State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('CM')` after
countries are seeded.

The 58 departments ship as level-2 areas under their regions.

Cameroon has no postcode system, so the formatter stacks street
lines, city, and country with no postcode line. Types are labelled
`Région` and `Département`.

## Madagascar

The bundled `MadagascarGeographyProvider` supplies the 6 provinces
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MG')` after
countries are seeded.
The 24 regions ship as level-2 areas under their provinces.

The regions have no ISO codes (ISO 3166-2:MG still lists the 6
former faritany); the 6 remain postally relevant since the
postcode's first digit routes by old province.

Malagasy addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {town}` with a 3-digit postcode, and country. Types are
labelled `Faritany` and `Faritra`.

## Afghanistan

The bundled `AfghanistanGeographyProvider` supplies the 34 provinces
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AF')` after
countries are seeded.

The 401 districts ship as level-2 areas from the OCHA Common
Operational Dataset on Administrative Boundaries (COD-AB v03,
valid 1 June 2025), which carries a UN p-code (`AF0101`-style)
and an explicit province parent per district. Afghan government
sources disagree on the district count over time (398/399/407 in
various CSO/IDLG/SIGAR vintages), so the COD — the operational
standard used by the UN and humanitarian community — is the
bundled source of truth; 33 provincial centres and Kabul city
ship as their own district rows. The `Ghor` and `Kunduz`
spellings are corrected at seed.

Afghan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
the locality on its own line, `{postcode} {province}` with a 6-digit
postcode (new province-encoded system from 1 October 2024), and
country. Province and district need no type labels (the bundled data
and COD source both use the English terms); provincial centres and
Kabul city stay typed `district` — capital status is an attribute,
not a distinct addressing tier.

## Mozambique

The bundled `MozambiqueGeographyProvider` supplies the 10 provinces
plus Maputo City as `State` rows and a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MZ')` after countries are seeded.

The 129 districts ship as level-2 areas under their provinces, plus
the 7 municipal districts under Maputo City. `Maputo Province` and
`Maputo City` are disambiguated at seed. Maxixe is excluded (city,
not a district).

Mozambican addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 4-digit postcode, the province on its
own line, and country. Types are labelled `Província`, `Cidade`,
and `Distrito`.

## Uzbekistan

The bundled `UzbekistanGeographyProvider` supplies the 12 regions
plus Karakalpakstan and Tashkent City as `State` rows and a
two-level administrative hierarchy (`region` > `tuman`). It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('UZ')` after
countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries 175 tumanlar plus the 31 cities of regional
subordination (typed `city`, sharing the `tuman` role — the
Indonesia regency+city precedent). L1 names keep their established
forms while L2 names use official Uzbek Latin endonyms (`Buxoro`,
`Farg'ona`, `Kattaqo'rg'on`, `Toshkent`); O'/G' use the ASCII
apostrophe. Seventeen tuman/city twins share a parent (Andijon,
Buxoro, Farg'ona, Kogon, Namangan, Nukus, Qarshi, Shahrisabz,
Samarqand, Kattaqo'rg'on, Guliston, Termiz, Bekobod, Ohangaron,
Yangiyo'l, Urganch, Xiva) — filter by `type` and parent, never by
name alone. `city` spans both levels (L1 Tashkent City vs L2
regional cities), disambiguated by level. Verified `alternative`
aliases: `Shayxontohur`, `Sergeli`, `Xazorasp`. Namangan city's
Davlatobod and Yangi Namangan districts are excluded: their parent
is Namangan city (L2), making them L3, which this provider does
not ship.

Region names use official Uzbek Latin forms (`Qashqadaryo`,
`Samarqand`, `Sirdaryo`, `Surxondaryo`, `Navoiy`, `Xorazm`).
`Tashkent Region` and `Tashkent City` are disambiguated at seed.

Uzbek addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode}, {locality}` with a 6-digit postcode, the region on its
own line (omitted when it duplicates the city), and country.

## Myanmar

The bundled `MyanmarGeographyProvider` supplies the 7 regions, 7
states, and Naypyidaw as `State` rows and a two-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MM')` after countries are seeded.
The 80 districts ship as level-2 areas from the OCHA
Common Operational Dataset on Administrative Boundaries
(MIMU Place Codes, valid 15 February 2024), which carries a
p-code (`MMR016001`-style) and an explicit parent per
district. Operational reality wins over announcement
reality: the April 2022 MOI announcement (Notifications
319–333, 76 + 46 = 121) was never operationalized, and the
reference table churns between counts, so the 80-district
MIMU operational list is the bundled source of truth.
MIMU splits Bago into East/West and Shan into East/North/
South (18 admin-1 units); those split parents are rolled up
into the ISO `Bago` and `Shan` states (Shan 16, Bago 4).
Townships are not bundled.

Myanmar addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality}, {postcode}` with a 7-digit postcode, the region or state
on its own line, and country. Region, state, union territory, and
district need no type labels (the MIMU English terms render
correctly).

## Cambodia

The bundled `CambodiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 24 provinces plus
Phnom Penh municipality as `State` rows and a two-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('KH')` after countries are seeded.
The 163 districts, 33 municipalities and 14 Phnom Penh sections ship as level-2 areas under their provinces.

Code `18` seeds the official `Preah Sihanouk` name with `Sihanoukville`
kept as an alternative area name. Communes (khum/sangkat) below the
districts are intentionally not bundled.

Cambodian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
the city above `{province} {postcode}` with a 6-digit postcode, and
country.

## Laos

The bundled `LaosGeographyProvider` supplies the 17 provinces plus the
Vientiane Prefecture as `State` rows and a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('LA')` after countries are seeded.
The 148 districts ship as level-2 areas under their provinces.

The Vientiane province (`VI`) and Vientiane Prefecture (`VT`) are
separate areas sharing a name.

Laotian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, the province on its
own line when both are set, and country. Types are labelled
`Khoueng` and `Muang`.

## Timor-Leste

The bundled `TimorLesteGeographyProvider` supplies the 13 ISO 3166-2
municipalities (Oecusse is a special administrative region) plus
Atauro — split from Dili in 2022 with provisional code `AT`, since
ISO has not assigned one yet — as `State` rows and a two-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('TL')` after countries are seeded.

Timor-Leste joined ASEAN as the 11th member in October 2025.
The 67 administrative posts ship as level-2 areas under their municipalities.

Timorese addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with a `TL` + 5-digit postcode, and country.

Yerevan as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy.
It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AM')` after countries are seeded.

Armenian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 4-digit postcode, the region on its
own line when both are set, and country. Regions and municipalities
are labelled `Marz` and `Hamaynk`; Yerevan city and its districts keep
English headlines.

## Azerbaijan

The bundled `AzerbaijanGeographyProvider` supplies the 66 districts
(rayonlar), 11 cities (şəhərlər), and the Nakhchivan Autonomous
Republic as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy.
It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AZ')` after countries are seeded.
The first-level cities share the `district` assignment role;
Nakhchivan keeps its own role.

The 685 local municipalities (bələdiyyə) ship as level-2 areas
from the State Statistical Committee classification (4,455
rows; municipality rows end in `007` plus 9 suffixed rows),
parented by the 3-digit district prefix. Baku's 12 intra-city
rayons parent to Baku city; where SSC codes a city and its
district together (Şəki, Lənkəran, Yevlax), the eponymous
municipality goes to the city and the rest to the district.
Liberated-territory districts and Aghdara are absent from SSC
and stay childless. Type and role are `local_municipality`
(L1 cities already own `municipality`).

The Lankaran, Shaki, and Yevlakh municipality/district pairs share
names by design, as do Nakhchivan city and the Nakhchivan Autonomous
Republic; filter by type.

Azerbaijani addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with an `AZ` + 4-digit postcode, the district
or region on its own line when both are set, and country.

place names (quarters keep their `Town (Quarter)` labels); the
dump covers all six districts including Keryneia.

Cypriot addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 4-digit postcode, and country.
Inbound international mail prefixes `CY-`; the formatter prints the
postcode exactly as supplied.

prints on its own line for form-compatibility.

## Iran

The bundled `IranGeographyProvider` supplies the 31 ostans
(provinces) as `State` rows and a two-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IR')` after countries are seeded.

The 429 counties (shahrestan) ship as level-2 areas from the
UN OCHA Common Operational Dataset v01, parented by province
pcode with English names and Persian native names. Vintage
warning: the dataset is stamped May 2019 and misses every
county split since (current claims run 480–491 but no
complete, parent-mapped, officially backed list exists — the
reference page disagrees with itself and cites a 2007 atlas,
and the Statistical Centre of Iran is unreachable). Refresh
from SCI when accessible.

## Lebanon

The bundled `LebanonGeographyProvider` supplies the 9 governorates
as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('LB')` after
countries are seeded. The 25 cazas ship as level-2 areas under
their governorates (Beirut has none — the governorate is the city).
Keserwan-Jbeil (split from Mount Lebanon in 2017) carries the
provisional code `KJ`: ISO 3166-2:LB still lists the 8 old
governorates.

Lebanese addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with the optional 4+4-digit LibanPost code,
the governorate on its own line when both are set, and country.

The 192 islands ship as level-2 areas under their atolls.
Malé is typed city (ISO MV-MLE), not an atoll. Gnaviyani atoll is
retired: Fuvahmulah city covers it entirely (ISO still lists MV-29).
Fuvahmulah (`FVM`), Kulhudhuffushi (`KUH`), and Thinadhoo (`THD`)
codes are invented pending ISO assignment.

Maldivian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with a 5-digit postcode, the atoll on its own
line when both are set, and country.

Common Operational Dataset on Administrative Boundaries
(valid 24 June 2019), which carries a p-code (`KP1102`-style)
and an explicit parent per district; Nampo nests cleanly with
6 children (no double placement). Two modelling notes:
COD-AB covers 11 of the 13 first-level units, so Kaesong and
Rason ship without subdivisions, and Pyongyang ships with 3
rows (city core plus Kangdong and Unjong counties) rather
than its full guyok set.

North Korea has no postcode system. Addresses are formatted per the
UPU layout: street lines, the locality, and country; any supplied
code prints on its own line. Province, city, and the generic district
(mixed si/gun rows) need no type labels; si/gun cannot split further
because the COD table carries no kind column.

## Palestine

The bundled `PalestineGeographyProvider` supplies the 16 West Bank
and Gaza governorates as `State` rows and a single-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PS')` after countries are seeded.

Directory (2022): each office row carries its postal division, mapped
to the 25 districts (APR and AR/Akkaraipattu both Ampara), with the
Colombo 01–15 zones completed from the book's scanned zone table.
Office-level codes link their district (Romania precedent); no new
area rows.

districts; Chobe and North-East have no subdistrict tier and the
cities and towns are terminal. The Central "Serowe - Palapye" entry
ships as two subdistricts (Serowe, Palapye).

## Burkina Faso

The bundled `BurkinaFasoGeographyProvider` supplies the 17 regions
as `State` rows plus the 47 provinces nested at level 2 under their
regions, in a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BF')` after countries are seeded.
The July 2025 reform renamed all 13 regions, renamed 5 provinces
(`Koosin`, `Gobnangou`, `Djelgodji`, `Sandbondtenga`, `Bassitenga`),
and added 4 regions plus `Karo-Peli` and `Dyamongou` provinces.
Renamed divisions keep their former codes (each successor region
keeps the old INSD code of the region it principally continues,
e.g. Bankui keeps `01` from Boucle du Mouhoun); region codes
`14`–`17` and province codes `KAR`/`DYA` are provisional pending
ISO 3166-2:BF. French Wikipedia's region table uses a different
unofficial numbering (e.g. Tapoa `16` / Sourou `17` swapped, and
different `01`–`13` assignments); no INSD or ISO publication for
the new numbering is known, so the succession scheme stands until
an official source rules.

Compositions follow the published reform details: Sourou region holds
`Koosin`, Nayala, and Sourou; Sirba holds Gnagna and Komondjari;
Tapoa holds `Gobnangou` and `Dyamongou` (Kantchari was a Tapoa
department); Goulmou holds Gourma and Kompienga; Liptako holds
Oudalan, Séno, and Yagha; Soum holds `Djelgodji` and `Karo-Peli`
(Arbinda was a Soum department); Bankui holds the remaining Balé,
Banwa, and Mouhoun; every other region keeps its pre-reform
composition under its new name. Provinces remain `State` rows for
compatibility and link their level-2 areas.

Spelling evidence (Sept 2026): `Koosin` follows the decree table and
Burkina Information Agency usage — the `Kossin` form appears only in
the Presidency communiqué prose quoted by news outlets. `Gobnangou`
follows the decree table; English Wikipedia still lists `Tapoa`
because its province page predates the reform. `Kuilsé` follows the
English Wikipedia primary article; the UK PCGN factfile prefers
`Koulsé` ("also seen Kuilsé").

Burkinabe addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, the region on its
own line when both are set, and country.
## Burundi

seeded. The 42 communes ship as level-2 areas under their provinces
(7/11/7/8/9 per province), verified against the RGPH 2024 census
commune tables; Gitega's Karusi spelling follows the census. The
July 2025 reform replaced the former 18 provinces; ISO
3166-2:BI has not issued new codes, so the bundled codes 01-05 are
provisional local numbers pending ISO.

and `Ouham-Fafa` (Batangafo), and retyped Bangui from commune to
prefecture; Sangha-Mbaéré is modelled as an economic prefecture.
ISO 3166-2:CF still lists only the former 17, so the bundled codes
`LP`/`ME`/`OF` are provisional pending ISO.

The country has no postcode system. Addresses are formatted per the

`Nkéni-Alima` (five districts from Plateaux), and `Djoué-Léfini`

Mobility Tracking baseline (Round 50, Oct–Dec 2023: `Baladiya
Main` sheet with a `LY021102`-style p-code and an explicit

(Mar–Apr 2026) carries the identical 100 (mantika, baladiya)
pairs, both rounds' summaries assert `# Baladiyas: 100`, and
IOM reports have used 100 consistently since 2017. Rival
counts (99 gazetted 2013, ~101, 106–114 claimed) lose to this
operational consensus. DTM mantika spellings map onto the ISO
popularates (Ejdabia→Al Wahat, Tobruk→Al Butnan,

to Taoudénit.

## Numeric state codes

Bahrain, Italy, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, Morocco, France,
Japan, Poland, Kenya, Tanzania, Algeria, Thailand, Vietnam, Ukraine,
Myanmar, Bhutan, Cyprus, Iran, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia,
Maldives, North Korea, Burkina Faso, Congo, Gabon, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles,
Tunisia, Zambia, Albania, Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Latvia,
Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia,
Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Serbia, and Slovenia use numeric
ISO subdivision codes at the state-mapping level. Aland, Guernsey,
Jersey, and Isle of Man use dataset-invented numeric codes instead
(ISO defines no subdivisions for them). PHP casts numeric-string array keys to
int, so
`stateAreaMappings()` returns int keys for those countries and the
contract documents `array<int|string, ...>`. `linkStateAreas()`
stringifies keys before querying, so seeding behaves identically on
every database driver.
