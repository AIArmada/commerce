# Country Data

For per-provider depth and dataset status at a glance, see the
[Provider Coverage Registry](./14-provider-coverage.md).

## Bundled Dataset

The package always bundles ISO 3166-1 country/territory data.

File location: `resources/data/countries.json`

The bundled `MalaysiaGeographyProvider` supplies Malaysia's State/Federal Territory catalog, two explicit address hierarchies, the AddressArea hierarchy, and State↔AddressArea mappings. The postal/address hierarchy is `region → locality / precinct / kampung`; the administrative/land hierarchy is `region → district / division / jajahan → mukim / subdistrict / bandar / pekan`. It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('MY')` after countries are seeded.

The dataset contains **250 records** — these are ISO 3166-1 address entities, not 250 sovereign countries. Records include:

- ISO2, ISO3, numeric codes
- Names (common, native)
- Phone codes
- Capital
- Country centroid coordinates
- Region and subregion
- Currency code
- Timezones
- Top-level domain
- Translated country names

Currency, language, and timezone reference data is owned and seeded by `commerce-support`:

- `currencies` from the shared currency catalogue
- `languages` from the shared ISO 639-1 catalogue
- `timezones` from the shared IANA timezone catalogue

Countries are linked to shared currencies and timezones through UUID pivot tables. The country table does not store currency or timezone JSON/scalar columns. Country-language relationships are intentionally not modelled until a trusted mapping dataset is available.

## What is NOT Bundled by Default

Without selecting a country provider, the following must be supplied by users through `State`/`City` models, `AddressAreaSource`, array imports, or CSV imports:

- States, federal territories, provinces, prefectures, emirates
- Districts, cities, towns, villages, mukim, neighbourhoods
- Postcodes and worldwide area hierarchies

## Bundled States and Cities

`states.json` and `cities.json` are bundled from the same nnjeim/world source. Seed the global files first; country providers then complement those rows using stable country-scoped identities. The Malaysia provider updates matching states in place and adds Malaysia-specific rows not present in the global file, such as Putrajaya. It does not seed shared commerce-support reference data. The bundled area source contains no canonical city mapping data.

## Malaysia area roles

Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan do not receive duplicate postal-town
records. Their Federal Territory is the administrative area, while localities,
precincts and settlements are address subdivisions.

- postal_locality: Kuala Lumpur localities, Labuan settlements and Putrajaya precincts
- administrative_district: districts
- administrative_subdivision: mukim and subdistricts
- region: states and Federal Territories

## Malaysia cross-boundary mukims

Several mukim names appear on both sides of a district or state boundary.
Every case was verified against gazettes, the JUPEM UPI boundary book, and
titled-land evidence (Sept 2026). The verdict in all four cases: distinct
same-named mukims, each with exactly one parent — never one mukim spanning
two parents. DOSM's "Sebahagian Mukim X (Peralihan ...)" phrasing describes
the 1974 Gombak-formation transfers, not current dual parentage.

| Mukim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Setapak | Two mukims: Gombak-side (Selangor gazette) and KL-side (Federal Gazette 2024, UPI 140007). A 1974-split remnant, administered separately ever since. |
| Ampang | Two mukims: Hulu Langat-side (MPAJ: "smallest county in the district of Hulu Langat") and KL-side (UPI 140001). The straddling *town*/MPAJ area is not a third mukim. |
| Batu | Two mukims: Gombak-side ("Mukim Batu bagi Daerah Gombak") and KL-side ("MUKIM BATU, DAERAH KUALA LUMPUR", UPI 140002). A third Mukim Batu sits in Kuala Langat. |
| Cheras | Two mukims: Hulu Langat-side and KL-side ("Mukim Cheras, Daerah Kuala Lumpur", UPI 140003). KL's P123 Cheras parliamentary constituency is a separate concept. |

## Kuala Lumpur mukims

WPKL has exactly seven gazetted mukims and no district (`TIADA DAERAH`), so
each hangs directly under the Federal Territory at level 2. Mukim rows use a
`mukim-` source-id prefix because the parliamentary localities already occupy
the bare names.

| Mukim | UPI / PLANMalaysia | DOSM census |
|---|---|---|
| Ampang | 140001 | 140101 |
| Batu | 140002 | 140102 |
| Cheras | 140003 | 140103 |
| Hulu Klang | 140004 | 140104 |
| Kuala Lumpur | 140005 | 140105 |
| Petaling | 140006 | 140106 |
| Setapak | 140007 | 140107 |

Notes:

- Bandar Kuala Lumpur is a gazetted bandar (UPI 140044), not a mukim, so it
  has no mukim row despite "Mukim Bandar Kuala Lumpur" title phrasing.
- The rows use the gazette/KWP "Hulu Klang" spelling; the JUPEM UPI
  "Hulu Kelang" form is stored as an alternative name.
- The duplicate Gombak "Ulu Kelang" mukim row was removed: Gombak has one
  Hulu Klang mukim, and "Ulu Kelang" is a gazetted town name there.

Evidence: JUPEM/MyGDI UPI book for WPKL (2nd ed. 2023), PLANMalaysia mukim
code list (state 14), DOSM census geography, Selangor State Gazette notices,
Federal Gazette P.U.(B) notices, ST licensee lists, and Bursa land
disclosures.

## Selangor mukim audit

Every Selangor subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Selangor (Sept 2026). All gazetted Selangor mukims were already bundled;
the fixes below correct mistyped towns, wrong districts, renames, and
non-gazetted rows. Bandar and pekan are distinct row types sharing the
`administrative_subdivision` role; renamed rows keep their common names as
alternative or preferred names so searches keep resolving.

Retyped to bandar (gazetted): Banting, Bandar Baru Bangi, Kuang, Kundang,
Selayang, Petaling Jaya, Saujana, Subang Jaya, Cyberjaya, Shah Alam, Kuala
Kubu Bharu. Retyped to pekan (gazetted): Meru, Sekinchan, Sungai Besar,
Puchong, Sungai Pelek.

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Port Klang | Renamed Port Swettenham, bandar | UPI Bandar Port Swettenham 01/41; "Port Klang" kept as preferred common name |
| Gombak | Renamed Gombak Setia, bandar | UPI Bandar Gombak Setia 09/43; bare "Gombak" not gazetted |
| Salak Tinggi | Renamed Baru Salak Tinggi, bandar | UPI Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi 10/42; bare name not gazetted |
| Tanjung Sepat | Renamed Tanjong Sepat, bandar | UPI Bandar Tanjong Sepat 02/43 |
| Jenjarum (Klang) | Moved to Kuala Langat as Jenjarom, bandar | UPI Bandar Jenjarom 02/41; town is in Kuala Langat |
| Batu Arang (Sepang) | Moved to Gombak, bandar | UPI Bandar Batu Arang 09/40; town is in Gombak |
| Bukit Rotan (Hulu Selangor) | Moved to Kuala Selangor, pekan | UPI Pekan Bukit Rotan 04/72; town is in Kuala Selangor |
| Jenjarum Barat / Utama | Removed | No such place or entity in UPI, gazettes, or SPR records |
| Johan Setia, Paya Jaras | Removed | Kampung/locality inside a mukim, not a UPI entity |
| Setia Alam, Denai Alam, USJ / UEP Subang Jaya, Taman Melawati | Removed | Developer townships inside a mukim, not UPI entities |
| Batu Caves | Removed | Town inside Mukim Batu, not gazetted at any level |
| Sabak Bernam, Hulu Selangor | Removed | District-name rows; the districts and their mukims already exist |
| Teluk Panglima Garang (Klang) | Removed | Wrong-district duplicate of Kuala Langat's Mukim Telok Panglima Garang |

Spelling follows the gazetted UPI form for renamed rows (Jenjarom, Tanjong,
Swettenham); rows that keep common spellings (Hulu Langat, Telok Panglima
Garang, Kuala Kubu Bharu) carry the UPI variant as an alternative name.
Postal links were repointed to the surviving rows; no postcode lost its
primary link.

## Genting Highlands

Genting Highlands is not a mukim of Bentong. Bentong has exactly three
mukims (Bentong, Sabai, Pelangai); the gazetted Genting unit is Bandar
Genting under Daerah Kecil Genting, excised from Mukim Bentong in November
2019 (Pahang Gazette Notifications 2497/2501, UPI 06/12/40). The dataset
models the minor district and the bandar; "Genting Highlands" is stored as
the preferred common name. Karak in the same pass was corrected from mukim
to bandar (UPI Bandar Karak).

The resort genuinely spans the Pahang–Selangor border: the Selangor
footprint (Highlands/RW Hotel, Skyway assets, Gohtong Jaya) sits in Hulu
Selangor district, Mukim Batang Kali, under MPHS planning authority — while
mailing with the Pahang postcode 69000. There is no gazetted Selangor-side
Genting entity, so no second row exists; never key state off the postcode.

Evidence: JUPEM UPI book for Pahang, Pahang Gazette 2019 declarations,
Genting Berhad annual-report land schedules (Selangor vs Bentong), the
Genting Highlands–Hulu Selangor RKK plan, and titled-land records on both
sides.

## Pahang mukim audit

Every Pahang subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Pahang (Sept 2026). Pahang has 11 districts plus 4 minor districts
(Genting, Gebeng, Jelai, Muadzam Shah — the last three created 2019–2021).
Retyped to bandar: Jerantut, Kuantan, Temerloh, Maran, Raub. Retyped to
pekan: Brinchang, Lanchang, Bukit Fraser, Kuala Rompin (UPI-listed, still
ungazetted).

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Gebeng (Kuantan) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Gebeng, bandar | UPI Bandar Gebeng 13/40 |
| Batu Yon, Hulu Jelai (Lipis) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Jelai, mukim | UPI Jelai 14/01–02; Hulu Jelai respelled Ulu Jelai |
| Telang | Kept under Lipis and added under Jelai | Two distinct mukims: Lipis 10 (Phg.733/2021) and Jelai 03 (Phg.520/2021) |
| Keratong (Rompin) | Moved under new Daerah Kecil Muadzam Shah, mukim | UPI Muadzam 15/01 |
| Bebar | Kept under Pekan and added under Muadzam Shah | Two distinct mukims: Pekan 01 (Phg.845/1992) and Muadzam 02 (Phg.732/2021) |
| Muadzam Shah (Rompin) | Removed; town is two bandars now modelled | UPI Muadzam Shah I/II (15/40–41) added under the minor district |
| Kuala Krau (Jerantut) | Moved to Temerloh as Kuala Kerau, pekan | UPI Pekan Kuala Kerau 08/72; common spelling kept preferred |
| Teras (Raub) | Renamed Tras, mukim | UPI Mukim Tras 07/07; "Teras" is an upstream typo with zero gazette hits |
| Bandar Kuantan, Bandar Bera | Removed | Duplicates of the Kuantan bandar and Bera mukim rows |
| Dong, Sega (Lipis) | Removed | Wrong-district duplicates of Raub's mukims |
| Balok, Bukit Goh, Bukit Kuin, Sungai Lembing | Removed | Non-gazetted Kuantan towns/schemes inside a mukim |
| Damak, Sungai Koyan, Chini, Kemayan | Removed | Non-gazetted kampung/FELDA localities |
| Bandar Pusat Jengka, Bandar Tun Abdul Razak, Lurah Bilut | Removed | Non-gazetted towns (Jengka rows duplicated one renamed town) |

Postal links were repointed to the surviving mukim, pekan, or district rows;
no postcode lost its primary link.

## Johor mukim audit

Every Johor subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Johor (Sept 2026). Retyped to bandar: Ayer Hitam, Bandar Penggaram,
Rengit, Senggarang, Yong Peng, Johor Bahru, Bandar Kluang, Bandar Kota
Tinggi, Bandar Mersing, Bandar Maharani, Batu Anam, Segamat, Bandar Kulai,
Bandar Tangkak. Retyped to pekan: Bukit Pasir, Pekan Nenas.

| Row | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Muar (Muar) | Renamed Bandar, kept mukim | UPI Mukim Bandar 06/02; town row is Bandar Maharani |
| Bandar Pontian | Renamed Pontian Kechil, bandar | UPI Bandar Pontian Kechil 07/41; Pontian Kechil is the town |
| Sungai Mati (Muar) | Moved to Tangkak, bandar | UPI Bandar Sungai Mati 22/43 |
| Bandar Johor Bahru, Bandar Segamat, Renggam, Gerisek, Seri Medan | Removed | Duplicates of the Johor Bahru bandar, Segamat bandar, Rengam, Grisek, and Sri Medan rows |
| Chaah (Kluang) | Removed | Wrong district; Chaah belongs to Segamat |
| Batu Pahat, Parit Raja, Parit Sulong, Semerah | Removed | Non-gazetted towns (town core is Bandar Penggaram) |
| Bandar Tiram, Gelang Patah, Iskandar Puteri, Masai, Pasir Gudang, Ulu Choh, Ulu Tiram | Removed | Non-gazetted JB towns/corridors inside a mukim |
| Divisyen Bandaraya | Removed | Not a place at all; an MBJB assessment-division label |
| Simpang Renggam, Bandar Penawar | Removed | Non-gazetted towns inside a mukim |
| Ayer Tawar 2, Pulau Satu | Removed | Wrong-district camp/island locality, non-gazetted |
| Endau (Mersing) | Removed | Non-gazetted town; the only gazetted Endau is Pahang's Mukim Endau |
| Bukit Gambir, Pagoh, Kukup | Removed | Non-gazetted towns/villages (Bukit Gambir is in Tangkak) |
| Bandar Tenggara, Gugusan Taib Andak | Removed | Non-gazetted FELDA schemes (Bandar Tenggara is in Kota Tinggi) |

UPI spelling variants are stored as alternative names (Nyior, Ulu Sungei
Sedili Besar, Sungei Pinggan, Renggam, Gerisek, Bandar Pontian). Postal
links were repointed to the surviving mukim, bandar, pekan, or district
rows; duplicate same-area links created by the merges were collapsed.

## Perlis

Perlis has no districts (`TIADA DAERAH`) and exactly 22 mukims, all already
bundled with exact names. Verified clean against the JUPEM UPI book; no
changes. Bandar Arau, Bandar Kangar, Pekan Kuala Perlis, and Pekan Kaki
Bukit exist but have no rows (missing entities are not added).

## Melaka mukim audit

Every Melaka subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Melaka (Sept 2026). Retyped to bandar: Melaka, Bandar Jasin, Bandar Alor
Gajah. Retyped to pekan: Asahan, Bemban. Same-name mukim/town duals keep
the mukim row and the town entity stays unlisted (missing entities are not
added): Merlimau, Kuala Sungai Baru, Sungai Rambai, Ayer Molek, Batu
Berendam, and the other Melaka Tengah duals. Removed: the
Bandaraya Melaka city-status label, both Ayer Keroh town rows (non-gazetted;
postcode 75450 spans Bukit Katil and Bukit Baru, so it links the district),
the Alor Gajah town duplicate, and the wrong-district Alor Gajah Asahan row
(Asahan town is Jasin's Pekan Asahan — the error came from its Alor Gajah
parliamentary seat). Kept on gazette evidence despite UPI naming quirks:
Ayer Pa'abas (UPI 03/01) and Sungai Baru Tengah (2004/2006 gazettes; UPI
shortens it to plain Sungei Baru).

## Penang mukim audit

Every Penang subdivision row was diffed against the JUPEM UPI boundary book
for Pulau Pinang (Sept 2026), cross-checked against PLANMalaysia kod-mukim,
DOSM census divisions, state gazettes, and land-title records. Retyped to
bandar (14): Bukit Mertajam, Perai, Butterworth, Kepala Batas, Nibong Tebal,
Air Itam, Bandar George Town, Batu Ferringhi, Gelugor, Jelutong, Tanjong
Bungah, Bukit Bendera (renamed from Penang Hill; gazetted Bandar Bukit
Bendera), Balik Pulau, Bayan Lepas. The island shares one mukim sequence:
Barat Daya is Mukim 1-12 plus Mukim A-J, Timur Laut is Mukim 13-18; Seberang
Perai Utara genuinely skips Mukim 15, so that row was removed. Removed 14
rows: non-gazetted town/area names (Permatang Pauh, Seberang Jaya, Kubang
Semang, Penaga, Tasek Gelugor, Simpang Ampat, Sungai Jawi, Batu Maung, Teluk
Kumbar), the state-name Pulau Pinang row (its George Town city postcodes move
to Bandar George Town), the USM institution row (11800 moves to Gelugor), the
SPU Mukim 15 gap row, and the Bandar Bukit Mertajam / Bandar Butterworth
duplicates. Postcodes remap to the true numbered mukim (Kubang Semang is SPT
Mukim 5, a district correction); Sungai Jawi straddles SPS Mukim 6+7 so 14200
links the district.

## Singapore

The bundled `SingaporeGeographyProvider` supplies the five ISO 3166-2 CDC
districts as `State` rows, the URA planning tree (5 regions, 55 planning
areas), and the postal tree (28 districts, 81 sectors; sector `74` is
unallocated). The postal hierarchy is `postal district → postal sector`; the
administrative hierarchy is `planning region → planning area`. It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('SG')` after countries are seeded.

CDC districts, URA regions, and postal districts are three independent
first-level partitions: a CDC district is never the parent of a planning area
or a postal sector. `State` rows link to matching district areas without a
hierarchy type so the bridge resolves them for any hierarchy.

Individual six-digit postcodes are intentionally not bundled. Every building
in Singapore has its own postcode, so the dataset is SingPost-scale. Resolve
operational postcodes on demand with `ResolveSingaporePostalCodesAction`,
which queries SLA's OneMap API and caches the results in `postal_codes` with
sector links. Use the bundled postal sectors (the first two postcode digits)
for area-level grouping. OneMap data requires attribution to OneMap/SLA in
applications that display it.

Singapore addresses are formatted as street lines followed by
`Singapore NNNNNN`. State and city lines are omitted when they are empty or
just repeat `Singapore`; a distinctive town value is kept on its own line.

## Indonesia

The bundled `IndonesiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 38 ISO 3166-2
provinces as `State` rows and one administrative hierarchy: 38 provinces →
514 regencies/cities → 7,285 districts. Area codes are the official
Kemendagri codes (2/4/6 digits) and `source_id` values embed them
(`id:province:11`, `id:regency:1101`, `id:district:110101`). It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ID')` after countries are seeded.

The area tree is derived from
[lokabisa-oss/region-id v1.0.1](https://github.com/lokabisa-oss/region-id/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
(MIT), keeping official names, codes, and parent links. Two province names
differ from that source so areas match the seeded states: `DKI Jakarta`
(source: `Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta`, the pre-2024 legal name) and `DI
Yogyakarta` (source: `Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta`, kept as an alias). The
current legal name `Daerah Khusus Jakarta` is also aliased.

Villages and urban villages (83,762 desa/kelurahan, level 4) ship as an
opt-in dataset in `indonesia-villages.csv`, from the same upstream release.
Set `addressing.geography.indonesia.villages` to `true`
(`ADDRESSING_INDONESIA_VILLAGES`) to seed them; the default seed stops at
districts.

ISO 3166-2 defines seven Indonesian geographical units (island groups such
as `ID-JW` Jawa) alongside the 38 provinces. Those units are not provinces
and were removed from the bundled state data; `seed()` also deletes any
stragglers from databases seeded before that fix, so `Papua` always resolves
to the province. Nusantara/IKN is a separate capital authority, not a 39th
province.

Villages (83,762) and individual five-digit postcodes are intentionally not
bundled. Import operational villages through `AddressAreaSource` and
postcodes through `ImportPostalCodesAction`.

Indonesian addresses are formatted as street lines, `kelurahan`/`desa` and
`kecamatan` components, `{kota} {postcode}`, province, and country, per the
UPU addressing layout.

## Brunei

The bundled `BruneiGeographyProvider` supplies the four ISO 3166-2
districts as `State` rows and one administrative hierarchy: 4 districts →
39 mukims (18 in Brunei-Muara, 8 each in Belait and Tutong, 5 in
Temburong). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BN')` after countries are seeded.

Mukim names follow Brunei government spellings (`Pengkalan Batu`, with
`Pangkalan Batu` aliased). Bruneian postcodes are six characters — two
uppercase letters (district, then mukim) followed by four digits — but no
complete public dataset exists, so postcodes are intentionally not bundled.
Import operational villages and postcodes through `AddressAreaSource` and
`ImportPostalCodesAction`.

Brunei addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, kampung
component, `{town or district} {postcode}` with the town preferred, and
country.

## Bahrain

The bundled `BahrainGeographyProvider` supplies the four ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows (codes `13`, `14`, `15`, `17` — there is no
`16` since the Central Governorate was abolished in 2014) and a
single-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BH')` after countries are seeded.

Bahraini addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{municipality} {postcode}` with a 3–4 digit postcode, and country.

## Qatar

The bundled `QatarGeographyProvider` supplies the eight municipalities
as `State` rows with 90 census zones as level-2 areas (57 Doha, 10 Al
Rayyan, 7 Al Wakrah, 7 Al Sheehaniya, 3 Al Khor, 3 Al Shamal, 2 Al
Daayen, 1 Umm Salal) in a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('QA')` after
countries are seeded. Zone numbers run 1–98 with 8, 9, 10, 11, 59, 87,
88, 89 unassigned; zones 50/57/58 sit in Doha, 69 in Al Daayen, and
96/97 in Al Rayyan, so filter by parent rather than assuming
contiguous ranges. Official PSA district names are kept as `official`
aliases; repeated district names across zones (Al Thumama ×3, Nuaija
×3, Al Bidda, Mushaireb, Old Al Ghanim, Fereej Bin Mahmoud, Onaiza,
Doha International Airport ×2 each) share names by design; filter by
code.

Municipality names use official English spellings (`Al Sheehaniya`,
`Al Shamal`, `Doha`); the ISO names `Ad Dawhah` and `Madinat ash
Shamal` are kept as aliases. Qatar has no postcode system — delivery
is by P.O. Box or zone/street — so the formatter stacks street lines,
city, and country with no postcode line.

## Kuwait

The bundled `KuwaitGeographyProvider` supplies the six ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows with 134 postal areas as level-2 areas
(31 Capital, 29 Ahmadi, 24 Jahra, 20 Farwaniya, 17 Hawalli, 13 Mubarak
Al-Kabeer) in a two-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('KW')` after countries are seeded.
Uninhabited islands (Miskan, Umm an Namil, Bubiyan, Warbah) are excluded;
blocks and per-area postcodes stay out of scope, and governorate/area
name twins (Farwaniya, Ahmadi, Jahra, Hawalli, Mubarak Al-Kabeer) share
names by design; filter by type.

Kuwaiti addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode left of the locality,
and country.

## Jordan

The bundled `JordanGeographyProvider` supplies the twelve ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(`governorate` > `liwa`). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('JO')` after countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries the 51 districts (liwa) from DOS Statistical Yearbook
2024 Table 2.4: Amman 9, Irbid 9, Karak 7, Balqa 5, Mafraq 4, Ma'an 4,
Zarqa 3, Tafilah 3, Ajloun 2, Aqaba 2, Madaba 2, Jerash 1. Canonical
names follow DOS romanization except where the shipped L1 spellings
already differ (Ajloun, Tafilah, Jerash, Deir Alla, Naour, Mahis and
Fuhais); DOS forms are kept as `official` aliases and
English-Wikipedia/citypopulation/PCGN spellings (Al-Quwairah, Shoubak,
Husseiniya, Kufrinjah, Wadi Al Seer, Aii, Faqou', Ruwayshid,
Quwaysimah, Jizeh, Mowaqqar, Hashimiyya) as `alternative` aliases.
DOS publishes no liwa codes, so L2 rows carry no `code`. Qada
(sub-districts) are out of scope and do not ship.

Jordanian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality} {postcode}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country.

## Oman

The bundled `OmanGeographyProvider` supplies the eleven ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(governorate → 63 wilayats). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('OM')` after countries are seeded.

Omani addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, a
3-digit postcode on its own line above the locality, and country.

## United Arab Emirates

The bundled `UnitedArabEmiratesGeographyProvider` supplies the seven
emirates as `State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy.
It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('AE')`
after countries are seeded.

The UAE has no postcode system — delivery is to P.O. Boxes only — so
the formatter stacks street lines, city, and country with no postcode
line.

## Saudi Arabia

The bundled `SaudiArabiaGeographyProvider` supplies the thirteen ISO
3166-2 regions as `State` rows (codes `01`–`12` and `14`; there is no
region `13`) and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('SA')` after
countries are seeded.

Saudi addresses are formatted per the UPU home-delivery layout:
street lines, a 5-digit postcode on its own line above the locality,
and country. Short addresses (`RAGI2929` style) and the separate P.O.
Box layout are not generated.

## Egypt

The bundled `EgyptGeographyProvider` supplies the 27 ISO 3166-2
governorates as `State` rows and a single-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('EG')` after countries are seeded.

Egyptian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
locality, governorate, a 7-digit postcode on its own line, and country.

## South Africa

The bundled `SouthAfricaGeographyProvider` supplies the nine ISO
3166-2 provinces as `State` rows and a single-level administrative
hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ZA')` after countries are seeded.

South African addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street
lines, locality, a 4-digit postcode below it, and country. The
province line is omitted when a postcode is present, per the UPU rule.

## Türkiye

The bundled `TurkiyeGeographyProvider` supplies the 81 ISO 3166-2
provinces as `State` rows and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(`province` > `district`). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('TR')` after countries are seeded.

Level 2 carries all 973 ilçeler. The 51 non-metropolitan provinces
each have a bare `Merkez` central district; the 30 metropolitan
provinces have multiple urban districts instead (no `Merkez` row).
The newest district is Derecik (Hakkâri), created in 2018 by Law 7148;
no district has been created since. Districts carry no `code`: no
official numeric ilçe code system was verified, so the column stays
empty. `Kazan` is kept as a `historic` alias (renamed Kahramankazan by
Law 6752 in 2016) and `Karadeniz Ereğli` as a `common` alias for
Zonguldak's `Ereğli`, which twins officially with Konya's `Ereğli`.
25 names twin across provinces (`Merkez` ×51, `Ereğli` ×2,
`Yenişehir` ×3, 22 pairs) — filter by `type` and parent, never by
name alone. YSK's qualified `{Province} Merkez` form is a YSK-table
convention, not the district name. Villages and neighbourhoods
(mahalle) are intentionally not bundled.

Turkish addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}/{province}` with a 5-digit postcode, and
country. Sub-locality postcode suffixes (`06050-01` style) are not
generated.

## Pakistan

The bundled `PakistanGeographyProvider` supplies the seven ISO 3166-2
subdivisions as `State` rows — four provinces plus the Islamabad
Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir
(`Azad Kashmir` is aliased) — and a two-level administrative hierarchy
(province/territory → 174 districts). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PK')` after countries are seeded.

Districts follow the late-2025 reorganization state: Punjab counts 42
(`Jampur` and `Taunsa` included), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counts 40
(Chitral split into Lower/Upper plus `Central Dir`, `Paharpur`, and
`Upper Swat` from the October 2025 batch), and Balochistan includes
`Hub`, `Karezat`, and `Surab`. The January/May 2026 Balochistan batch
(`Tump`, Upper Dera Bugti, `Taftan`, `Wadh`, `Barshor`, Quetta
East/West) is intentionally excluded: unlike the clean October 2025
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa adds, its January Quetta City/Saddar and May Quetta
East/West notifications contradict each other. Tehsils are
intentionally not bundled.

Pakistani addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{locality}-{postcode}` with a 5-digit dash-separated postcode, and
country.

## India

The bundled `IndiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 36 ISO 3166-2 states
and union territories as `State` rows (28 states, 8 union territories
including Ladakh and the merged Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and
Diu) and a two-level administrative hierarchy (`state` > `district`).
It is selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IN')` after
countries are seeded. State codes follow the 23 November 2023 ISO
amendment (`CG`, `OD`, `TS`, `UK`).

Level 2 carries 786 districts keyed by official LGD code
(`in:district:<lgd-code>`, LGD snapshot 31 May 2026): all 784 LGD rows
plus Mahe (599) and Yanam (601), which LGD dropped in 2024–25 but which
remain official Puducherry districts with Census 2011 codes 636/634.
Names follow current official spellings, including the January 2026
Delhi reorganisation (Shahdara dissolved; Old Delhi, Central North,
Outer North added), Kushavati, Hansi, Markapuram, Polavaram, Vav-Tharad,
Meluri, Sribhumi, Ahilyanagar, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Dharashiv,
Bengaluru South and Narmadapuram, with former and LGD-variant names kept
as aliases. Three cross-state twins exist (Bilaspur, Hamirpur,
Pratapgarh) — filter by `type` and parent, never by name alone.
Excluded for lack of LGD codes: the five Ladakh districts notified 27
April 2026, the announced-but-unnotified Kalyan Singh Nagar (UP), and
West Bengal's unimplemented announced seven. Tehsils/blocks (L3) are out
of scope.

Indian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
locality, state, a 6-digit postcode on its own line, and country.
Secondary postcodes (`834001-34` style) are intentionally not bundled.

## United Kingdom

The bundled `UnitedKingdomGeographyProvider` supplies the four nations
(England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) as areas in a
single-level administrative hierarchy. The 221 ISO 3166-2 subdivisions
remain global `State` rows only; they are not imported as areas. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('GB')` after
countries are seeded.

British addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, post
town, the uppercased postcode on its own line, and country. The county
line is omitted when a postcode is present, per the UPU rule.

## Bangladesh

The bundled `BangladeshGeographyProvider` supplies the eight ISO
3166-2 divisions as `State` rows plus all 64 districts, with one
administrative hierarchy: 8 divisions → 64 districts (Dhaka 13,

Mymensingh 4). It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('BD')` after countries are seeded.

Names follow the post-2018 official English spellings (`Barishal`,
`Chattogram`, `Bogura`, `Jashore`, `Cumilla`, `Jhalakathi`,
`Netrokona`); seeding also corrects the matching global state rows.
Only divisions link to states; districts are assignable through the
`district` role with their division selected first.

Bangladeshi addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
an optional `thana` component, `{locality} - {postcode}` with a
4-digit postcode, and country.

after countries are seeded.

Region names follow ISO (`Marrakech-Safi`, `Fès-Meknès`,
`Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceïma`, `L'Oriental`); the `(EH)` Western Sahara
annotations from the global source are stripped, and seeding corrects
the matching global state rows. Only regions link to states;
provinces and prefectures are assignable through the `province` role
with their region selected first.

Moroccan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode left of the locality,
and country.

## China

The bundled `ChinaGeographyProvider` supplies 33 provincial-level
divisions as `State` rows (22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4
municipalities, plus Hong Kong and Macao) and a single-level
administrative hierarchy. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('CN')` after countries are seeded.

Taiwan carries its own country code (`TW`) with its own postal
system, so it is intentionally not a CN area. Prefecture-level cities,
counties, and districts are intentionally not bundled.

Chinese addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines, an
optional city/district line, `{postcode} {province}` with a 6-digit
postcode, and country.

## Russia

The bundled `RussiaGeographyProvider` supplies the 83 ISO 3166-2
federal subjects as `State` rows (46 oblasts, 21 republics, 9 krais,
4 okrugs, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and the Jewish Autonomous
Oblast) and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is selected
with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('RU')` after countries are
seeded.

Crimea, Sevastopol, and the territories claimed in 2022 are not
ISO-recognized subdivisions and are intentionally absent. Nenets is
typed as an okrug (the global snapshot mistypes it), and krai/okrug
names carry their suffixes per the UPU province list.

Russian addresses are formatted as street lines, locality, subject,
a 6-digit postcode, and country — country last, per the UPU IB
recommendation. Domestic Russian convention prints the postcode after
the country instead; the formatter deliberately deviates.

## Germany

The bundled `GermanyGeographyProvider` supplies the 16 Länder as
`State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('DE')` after
countries are seeded.

State names use German official forms (`Bayern`, `Sachsen`); the

`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country. CEDEX
suffixes are not generated.

## Italy

The bundled `ItalyGeographyProvider` supplies the 20 regions as
`State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy. Provinces
are intentionally not bundled: Friuli-Venezia Giulia replaced its
provinces with regional entities, Sardinia restructured twice in a
decade, and Sicily uses consortia, so no stable province layer exists
to ship. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IT')` after countries are seeded.

Region names use Italian official forms (`Toscana`, `Sicilia`); the
eight common English exonyms (`Piedmont`, `Aosta Valley`, `Lombardy`,
`Trentino-South Tyrol`, `Tuscany`, `Apulia`, `Sicily`, `Sardinia`)
are kept as aliases.

Italian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,

in as municipalities), and the 6 Northern-Territories paper villages
(Shikotan, Tomari, Ruyobetsu, Rubetsu, Shana, Shibetoro — Japanese
claimed/notional rows under Hokkaido). Names use bare unmacroned
romanization (`Sapporo`, `Chiyoda`, `Naha`) with kanji in `native_name`;
municipality kind (city/town/village/ward) is carried by the kanji
suffix only. Thirteen same-prefecture name twins exist (Tomari ×2 in
Hokkaido, Fuchu city/town in Hiroshima, Toshima ward/village in Tokyo,
and ten more) plus ~100 cross-prefecture twins (Date, Fuchu) — filter
by `code` and parent, never by name alone. Ordinance-designated-city
wards (e.g. Osaka's 24 ku) are sub-municipal and intentionally not
bundled.

Japanese addresses are formatted per the UPU western layout: street
lines, `{city}, {prefecture}`, the `NNN-NNNN` postcode on its own
line, and country.

lines, `{locality} {ST} {ZIP}` with the state abbreviation resolved
from a full-name map (already-abbreviated values pass through
uppercased), and country.

communities plus Ceuta and Melilla as `State` rows, with all 50
provinces, and one administrative hierarchy: 19 communities/cities →
50 provinces. It is selected with
`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('ES')` after countries are seeded.

Community names use short English forms (`Extremadura`, `Asturias`,
`Murcia`, `Madrid`) while provinces keep official local spellings
(`A Coruña`, `Bizkaia`, `Gipuzkoa`, `Araba`, `Ourense`, `Illes
Balears`). Only communities link to states; provinces are assignable
through the `province` role with their community selected first.

Spanish addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, the province on its
own line, and country.

`State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('PL')` after

Poland`) since the official Polish forms are adjectives, not
standalone proper nouns. Powiats and gminas are intentionally not
bundled.

Councils (typed `area_council`, sharing the `lga` role). Names follow
the post-2023 gazetted forms from the Fifth Alteration (Afikpo, Edda,
Ghari, Yewa North/South, Atisbo, Obio-Akpor) with pre-2023 names kept
as `historic` aliases. `Aiyekire` keeps its constitutional spelling
with `Gbonyin` (state usage, preferred) and `Ayekire` as aliases; the
Barkin Ladi → Gwol rename failed in the Senate and is not applied.
Six cross-state twins exist (Obi, Bassa, Ifelodun, Irepodun, Surulere,
Nasarawa) — filter by `type` and parent, never by name alone.
State-created LCDAs (e.g. Lagos's 37) and the October 2025 NASS
state/LGA-creation talks are excluded: only gazetted LGAs ship.

Ethiopia). Seeding deletes any `SN` straggler rows, and the bundled
state data no longer ships the code. South Ethiopia (`SE`) and Central
Ethiopia (`CE`) have no ISO codes yet; those codes are provisional
and will be updated when ISO assigns them.

Ethiopian addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 4-digit postcode, and country.

## Democratic Republic of the Congo

## Uganda

The bundled `UgandaGeographyProvider` supplies the four regions as
`State` rows in a single-level administrative hierarchy. The 130+

`SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('UG')` after countries are seeded.

Ugandan addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street lines,
`{postcode} {locality}` with a 5-digit postcode, and country.

exécutif 91-306 as amended by décret 26-253 (JO 2026 n°52), which
moves all other dairas whole and creates exactly one new daira
(El Aricha, from split-off Sebdou communes); El Borma sits in
Ouargla per the 2021 formalization, superseding its 2019 Touggourt
assignment. Names use French official forms (`Alger`, not `Algiers`;
daira `Bou Saada` without the wilaya's â, daira `El Meniaa` against
wilaya `El Menia`). The cross-wilaya `Mansoura` twin (Bordj Bou
Arréridj + Ghardaïa) — filter by `type` and parent, never by name
alone. Communes (1,541) are intentionally not bundled.

selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('VN')` after
countries are seeded.

The June 2025 merger (63 → 34, districts eliminated) is reflected as

Vietnamese addresses are formatted per the UPU layout: street and
ward lines, `{province} {postcode}` with a 5-digit postcode, and

are churny (ARMM→BARMM in 2019, Negros Island Region re-created in
2024 without an ISO code), while provinces are the address-relevant
unit. Cities and barangays are intentionally not bundled.
`Samar` keeps `Western Samar` as an alias.

selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('IQ')` after
countries are seeded.

`Iqlim Kurdistan` is ISO-listed as a region (`IQ-KR`) overlapping
Erbil, Dohuk, Sulaymaniyah, and Halabja — not a governorate. Since
governorates are the address-relevant unit, seeding deletes any `KR`
straggler rows and the bundled state data no longer ships the code.
Halabja (governorate in Kurdistan since 2014, federally since April
2025) has no ISO code yet; `HL` follows UK government usage pending

Moxico Leste, and the Cuando/Cubango split, 21 total) is enacted but,
per official sources, not yet implemented — so the shipped 18 track
implemented reality, and the new units will be added once live.

city, and country with no postcode line.

## Cameroon

The bundled `CameroonGeographyProvider` supplies the 10 regions as
`State` rows and a single-level administrative hierarchy. It is
selected with `SeedCountryGeographiesAction::execute('CM')` after

own line, and country.

## Uzbekistan

The bundled `UzbekistanGeographyProvider` supplies the 12 regions

at the state-mapping level. PHP casts numeric-string array keys to
int, so
`stateAreaMappings()` returns int keys for those countries and the
contract documents `array<int|string, ...>`. `linkStateAreas()`
stringifies keys before querying, so seeding behaves identically on
every database driver.

## Seed Command

```bash
php artisan address:seed-countries
