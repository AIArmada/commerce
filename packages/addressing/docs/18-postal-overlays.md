title: Postal Overlays

# Postal Overlays

How postcode data is bundled per country, and the overlay verdict for
all 228 providers. The grouping machinery (`postal_locality` roles,
`refinedBy`, grouped subdivision/locality controls) is generic — see
[locality expansion](15-locality-expansion.md) — this doc records which
countries use it and why the rest do not.

## Verdicts

- `complete` — postcode CSVs bundled and imported (see table below).
- `runtime` — resolves postcodes at runtime instead of CSVs
  (Singapore via OneMap).
- `none` — no national postcode system (UPU list + formatter evidence).
  Supplied codes still print as pass-through; nothing to import.
- `admin-ready` — bundled admin already covers towns; only the
  postcode→area links are queued (compilation work, no new rows).
- `expansion` — towns are not covered by bundled rows (or codes run
  below locality granularity); needs doc-15 locality rows first.

## Dataset rules

- File pair per country: `{slug}-postal-codes.csv`
  (`country_code,code`) and `{slug}-postal-code-areas.csv`
  (`postcode,area_source_id,relationship_type,is_primary`).
- Exactly one primary link per postcode that has links
  (enforced by `PostalCodeCsvImportTest`).
- Bundled postcodes are stored at base level. Suffixed formats
  resolve through their base at lookup: full 8-char Argentine CPA
  (`N4419ABC`, `C1406DOB`) strips to the bundled base (`4419`,
  `C1406`) via the country provider's lookup keys. Block-face
  suffixes carry no L2 signal and are out of scope for every
  built set.
- Single national codes shared by many rows import code-only (no
  links): the code does not discriminate areas (Niue, Nauru,
  Turks and Caicos, Anguilla).
- Shared codes take primary = office-holding / admin-center commune
  (documented per country below); catch-alls with no office holder
  take the largest commune.
- Excluded: delivery-point-only fragments (Les Abymes 97101–97109
  sectors are internal routing, not delivery codes), delivery-type
  variants (Monaco 98001–98099), PO-box-only ranges (Andorra la
  Vella box ranges), uninhabited stations without admin rows
  (Clipperton 98799, Greenland 3982/3984/3985), and private
  carrier-internal codes (Parcelforce Panama agency codes).
- Liechtenstein 9489 is omitted: sources split between Schaan and
  Vaduz and the newest compilation drops it. Re-add from
  Liechtensteinische Post evidence only.
- Iceland 512 is omitted: the register serves Ísafjarðardjúp farms
  near Hólmavík and the commune (Súðavík vs Ísafjarðarbær) cannot
  be settled from published sources. Re-add from Pósturinn
  evidence only.
- Faroe Islands FO-485 spans Runavík and Eystur (Skálafjørður):
  Runavík primary, Eystur secondary.
- Saint Lucia LC01 501 Marisule is dual-linked: Castries primary
  per the government addressing table, Gros Islet secondary (border
  area).
- Parked for lack of a verifiable complete source (do not ship
  partial compilations):
  - Bahrain: overturned — SLRB states 478 Logical Map Boundaries
    following the administrative blocks, matching the shipped 479
    (the earlier ~1000+ was the number range, not the used count).
  - Guernsey/Jersey/Isle of Man: UK-style street-level codes
    (ONSPD enumerates them but carries no CI/IOM coordinates;
    Guernsey finder API works per full code but caps broader
    queries). Needs a polite per-code attribution batch (~9k
    finder queries) or PAF access.
  - Egypt: access recheck 2026-09-25: https://egyptpost.gov.eg/
    returns HTTP 403 and https://www.egyptpost.org/ timed out. The
    official BareedMall page
    (https://bareedmall.egyptpost.org/bareedmallstorefront/bareedmall/ar/v/Enpo)
    is a stamp shop, not a postal directory; its current indexed copy
    has no allocation rows and direct fetch returned 502. No complete
    source, row count, data vintage, or reuse terms are available.
    MapAnet remains thin (371 rows / 81 codes); needs Egypt Post data
    or a reachable full office directory.
  - Trinidad and Tobago: access recheck 2026-09-25: current TTPost
    status page (https://ttpost.net/news/postal-code/) says the system
    is complete and codes are available for all addresses, but queries
    are handled by email or WhatsApp; it publishes no allocation rows
    or downloadable list. The 2017 FAQ
    (https://ttpost.net/2017/02/27/trinidad-tobago-postal-code-system-tt-pcs-2/)
    likewise directs users to TTPost outlets. No dataset vintage or
    reuse terms are published; GeoNames has no TT export.
  - Samoa: access recheck 2026-09-25 found the official Samoa Post
    list at https://www.samoapost.ws/index.php/special-services/post-code-for-samoa
    (HTTP 200; robots.txt permits the page): 224 village/postcode
    pairs, 224 unique codes, 221 distinct names. The page has no
    published vintage or data reuse terms. Its Upolu/Savaii grouping
    does not provide district attribution; normalized matching against
    the bundled 342 villages gives 159 unique matches, 7 ambiguous
    names, and 58 entries with no row. The UPU addressing-sheet copy
    (https://youbianku.com/files/upu/WSM.pdf) confirms Manono Tai
    WS1190, while GeoPostcodes
    (https://www.geopostcodes.com/en-GB/country/samoa/postcode/)
    assigns it to A'ana. GeoNames' current source registry
    (https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes-sources.html) lists only
    one WS row, with no date. Obtain an authoritative district
    crosswalk and reuse terms before building; do not ship a partial
    overlay.
  - Kuwait: access recheck 2026-09-25: the official MOC page
    (https://www.moc.gov.kw/en/important-links?tab=2) advertises
    separate P.O.-box and block-number tables, but its indexed view
    contains only empty table headers and filters; direct fetch timed
    out. No allocation rows, vintage, or reuse terms were retrieved.
    PACI Kuwait Finder remains unreachable and GeoNames has no KW
    export. MapAnet's 349 rows remain unattributable at L2 (Jahra's
    92 rows lumped under one locality; Ahmadi has 9; block suburbs
    are empty).

  - Timor-Leste: access recheck 2026-09-25: https://ctl.tl/ failed
    DNS resolution (`nodename nor servname provided, or not known`).
    The official UPU sheet
    (https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/tlsEn.pdf)
    already documents TL+5 and examples (including TL11212 and
    TL42000); its indexed copy is about five years old and contains
    no allocation table. This qualifies the “brand new” description
    in the August 2026 profile but does not provide a usable list.
    No allocated-code rows, current vintage, or reuse terms are
    available; revisit when Correios de Timor-Leste publishes a list.
  - Uganda: access recheck 2026-09-25: https://ugapost.go.ug/ redirects
    to https://web.ugapost.go.ug/ and returns HTTP 200 with a 559-byte
    app shell, not a postcode allocation. The official UPU sheet
    (https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/ugaEn.pdf)
    timed out while fetching. UCC's 2026-06-11 “Allocation Chart” page
    (https://www.ucc.co.ug/download/allocation-chart-uganda/) exposes
    no postcode rows. The Ministry of ICT's FY2025/26–2029/30 plan
    (https://ict.go.ug/public/site/documents/ict-strategic-plan-202526-202930.pdf)
    labels the National Postcode and Addressing System “Concept” and
    describes work to develop/adopt it. No allocation vintage, rows,
    or reuse terms are published. The E-Posta API remains
    authentication-gated; needs a public Posta Uganda allocation list.
  - Cape Verde: access recheck 2026-09-25: https://www.codigopostal.cv/
    timed out after 12 seconds. The current operator FAQ
    (https://www.correios.cv/faq, HTTP 200; last updated 2020) gives
    only three four-digit examples (7600, 7601, 7602) and points to a
    “Pesquisar Códigos Postais” home-page icon; the live home page
    exposes no finder. The branch-contact page
    (https://www.correios.cv/contactos; last updated 2019) is not a
    territory-wide CPN table. No allocation vintage or open-data
    reuse grant was found; the general terms
    (https://www.correios.cv/termos-e-condicoes) retain an
    all-rights-reserved notice. GeoNames' registry has no CV rows.
    Needs the complete Correios list.
  - Myanmar: access check 2026-09-25: MapAnet MM holds Yangon
    townships only (89 rows / 87 5-digit codes, r1=11); the live
    system is 7-digit per UPU mmrEn 11/2022 (0505001, 1118001,
    0213202) with township-level allocation. GeoNames has no MM
    export and youbianku carries region prefixes only. Needs a
    township code list plus a township→district crosswalk (townships
    unbundled); do not ship the Yangon fragment.
  - Guyana: access recheck 2026-09-25: the official finder
    https://guypost.gy/find-your-postcode/ returns HTTP 403. The
    official explainer
    https://guypost.gy/understanding-postcodes-in-guyana/ describes
    the 7-digit fields and one example (2210201), but contains zero
    allocation rows and publishes no dataset vintage or reuse terms.
    GeoNames' registry has no GY rows. Needs a public allocation list
    from Guyana Post.
  - Venezuela: access recheck 2026-09-25: GET
    https://www.ipostel.gob.ve/ timed out after 12 seconds. No public
    IPOSTEL allocation endpoint or downloadable table was found;
    GeoNames' current registry has no VE row. No rows, vintage, or
    reuse terms are available. Needs IPOSTEL data.
  - Nicaragua: access recheck 2026-09-25: the official summary endpoint
    https://www.correos.gob.ni/postalcode/postalcodes.php returns
    HTTP 403. Search-indexed copies show the summary with no results
    and blank totals plus individual historical records (for example,
    https://www.correos.gob.ni/postalcode/PostalCodes.php?operation=view&pk0=13082),
    but expose no complete export or count. GeoNames' registry names
    Correos de Nicaragua as the official source but has blank row/date
    fields. No dataset vintage or reuse terms are published. Do not
    bypass the live block; needs a public Correos list.
  - Honduras: access recheck 2026-09-25: https://honducor.gob.hn/
    returns HTTP 200, but the accessible home/search results yielded
    no postcode allocation list. The previously observed HONDUCOR
    search ModSecurity block was not retried. GeoNames' current source
    registry (https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes-sources.html)
    lists 38 HN rows/matches, no source URL, and no vintage date,
    against 298 municipalities; that is insufficient coverage. No
    complete-source reuse terms are available. Needs HONDUCOR data.
  - Tajikistan: access recheck 2026-09-25 surfaced an official
    Tajik Post index page
    (https://tajikpost.tj/ru/перечень-почтовых-индексов-таджикистан/)
    in the search index with oblast, district, and locality columns,
    but a direct GET returned HTTP 404. The indexed copy provides no
    stable downloadable table, stated vintage, or reuse terms; a
    complete live allocation could not be verified. No CSV was built.
  - Lesotho: access recheck 2026-09-25: the operator URLs
    (https://lesothopost.org.ls/ and https://lps.org.ls/) are not
    fetchable from this network. The UPU addressing sheet
    (https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/LSOEn.pdf),
    dated 09/2004, confirms 3-digit codes and only the Maseru 100
    example; it has no allocation table. No complete row count,
    current vintage, or reuse terms are available. GeoNames has no LS
    export and third-party lists still conflict (Leribe 300 vs 9730);
    MapAnet crawl returns zero records.
  - Oman: access recheck 2026-09-25: the official locator
    (https://www.omanpost.om/office-locator) remains a branch lookup,
    not a downloadable allocation. Its previously counted 213 entries
    omit known offices (Muttrah 125, Khoula 127, Seeb Airport 128)
    and conflict with the established 2019–2024 numbering (Mutrah
    169, Airport Heights 111). No complete current list, data vintage,
    or reuse terms are available; needs an authoritative Oman Post
    export. (MapAnet crawl: 519 rows / 86 codes, unattributed —
    partial against the locator's 213 branches.)
  - Bahrain: the open data portal publishes no postcode/block
    dataset (mailbox/PO-box stats only) and block-level codes need
    city/block modeling first. Needs a block list with governorate
    mapping.
  - Morocco: access recheck 2026-09-25 found the official code finder
    (https://www.codepostal.ma/index.aspx), with searches by
    neighborhood, street, or Barid Al-Maghrib agency and a link to
    download its directory; the page and PDF
    (https://www.codepostal.ma/annuaire.pdf) both timed out on direct
    fetch. The Moroccan open-data portal also indexes “Codes postaux
    des quartiers” under Poste Maroc, but its dataset page timed out
    and the catalog query returned HTTP 403. No data rows, row count,
    vintage, or reuse license could be verified. GeoNames' 1,325-row
    dump still lacks Casablanca and Rabat codes.

## Queue scoping

`admin-ready` countries need only postcode→area compilation against
already-bundled rows. Done: Åland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Saint
Lucia, Saint Vincent, Barbados, Kosovo, US Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Moldova, Philippines, Maldives, Albania, Denmark, Guatemala,
Slovenia, Croatia, Mauritius, Norway, Luxembourg, Lithuania,
Latvia, Azerbaijan, Romania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Eswatini, Brunei, Bhutan, Mongolia, Greece,
Vietnam, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Cyprus, Djibouti.
Still queued: the parked countries (see rules) and the
remaining `admin-ready` verdicts above.

`expansion` countries need doc-15 locality rows first. Street-level
systems additionally need sub-locality data or licensed files:
Guernsey/Jersey/Isle of Man (Royal Mail PAF, licensed),
Brazil (CEP), Argentina (CPA base level built; block-face
suffixes out of scope per Dataset rules), Mexico (colonias), Colombia
(6-digit), Netherlands (4+2), Sweden (PostNord), Canada
(FSA level built; LDU suffixes out of scope per Dataset rules),
United States (ZIP level built; cross-county secondaries need licensed USPS file), Japan (Japan Post open data), South Korea (5-digit level built), Australia (PAF licensed), Taiwan (district level built; 3+3 suffixes out of scope per Dataset rules), Portugal (street suffix), Palestine (locality areas), Russia
(subject level built; tier-2 raions pending a GAR extract — see
the Russia section in [country data](05-country-data.md)).
France can join Hexasmal
once its 35k communes are bundled; Great Britain via CodePoint
Open once post towns are modeled.

## Findings (not changed)

- Burkina Faso and Gabon: UPU lists no postcode system but the
  formatters print supplied codes (pass-through). Verdict `none`;
  formatter behavior untouched.
- Ghana: GhanaPost GPS/digital addresses are not postcodes.
  Verdict `none`; formatter passes supplied codes through.
- Panama: no national postcode system (Parcelforce agency codes are
  carrier-internal). Doc 05 already says so; verdict `none`.
- Malawi: UPU postcode-type table lists MW as N (no system);
  delivery is via P.O. boxes. Verdict `none`.
- Hong Kong 999077 and French Southern Territories codes are
  foreign-administered routing codes, not domestic systems.
- Tajikistan: 6-digit system exists but no open district-level
  source found (GeoNames missing, Mapanet prefix-only 734/735/736,
  Tajik Post unreachable, scrapers empty). Still `expansion`.
  Verdict `none`.
- Israel has no geography provider yet; provider creation is
  separate work outside this overlay pass.
- Trinidad and Tobago: per-address 6-digit S-42 system (PP-RR-ZZ per
  UPU; 72 postal districts per Wikipedia) but no open code-level
  source (TTPost finder is email/WhatsApp-only, GeoNames has no TT
  dump, Mapanet 4 rows, Overpass unreachable). Still `expansion`.
