# Provider Coverage Registry

At-a-glance depth and dataset status for every bundled geography
provider. Update the row whenever a provider gains a level, changes
counts, or changes scope. See [Country Data](./05-country-data.md)
for per-country narrative and [Provider Authoring](./13-provider-authoring.md)
for how to add a level.

Current shape: 229 providers — 2 dual-hierarchy, 1 depth-3, 26 depth-2,
200 depth-1.
All 229 providers ship a formatter: 181 print a postcode (←99 →39 US →8 above6 below28 after country1), 48 codeless.

## Legend

- **States** — `State` rows the provider seeds (`stateDefinitions`).
- **Mapped** — state-to-area links (`stateAreaMappings`).
- **Rows** — data rows in the country's `*-address-areas.csv`.
- **Depth** — tiers in the administrative hierarchy (`dual a+b` lists
  each hierarchy for two-hierarchy providers).
- **Hierarchy** — hierarchy key with its level chain.
- **Roles** — assignable area roles the provider defines (`—` means the
  state *is* the area and there is nothing to assign).
- **Fmt** — postcode position the formatter implements: `←` code
  left of the locality, `→` code right of it, `US →` US-system
  `LOCALITY ST ZIP` line, `above`/`below` code on its own line
  above/below the locality, `after country` code after the
  country line (Singapore), `none` no postcode system (a supplied
  code prints on its own line).
- **Status** — `Complete` (at designed depth), `L1` (level-1 only),
  plus scope notes. `candidate` marks a researched next tier;
  `out of scope` marks a deliberate exclusion.

## Not Covered

21 countries have no subdivisions in the source data, so no provider
or formatter. Uninhabited territories need nothing further; the rest
are candidates when a subdivision source appears. Mail routes noted
where verified (UPU Sep-2025 database).

## Maintaining This File

Each column traces to one place:

- **States** — count of `['name' =>` entries in the provider's
  `stateDefinitions()`.
- **Mapped** — entries in the provider's `stateAreaMappings()`.
- **Rows** — data rows in `resources/geography/<slug>-address-areas.csv`.
- **Depth / Hierarchy / Roles** — the provider's `addressHierarchies()`.
- **Status** — hand-curated. Keep it to one line: what is bundled,
  the next researched tier (`candidate`), or the reason deeper data
  is excluded (`out of scope`, `blocked`, or the volatility note).
- **Fmt** — the formatter's `// UPU:` comment, classified per the
  Legend; keep the shape-line totals in sync.
- **Not Covered** — re-check states.json when the source refreshes;
  a country graduates by gaining subdivisions.

When a batch adds a level, update this row, the country's section in
[Country Data](./05-country-data.md), and the CSV line in
`resources/geography/README.md` in the same pass.
